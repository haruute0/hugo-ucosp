      <p>The fall projects are now available. We are happy to welcome back six projects from recent years. These include two projects that have been with us since the beginning or nearly the beginning of UCOSP: Reviewboard and Umple. We are welcoming back Julian and the Formulize project as well as three projects from Mozilla: Firefox development tools, Code Coverage, and Task Cluster.
Our new projects include another Firefox Development Tools project on the React debugger, and two new projects with a more analytic focus.</p>

      <p>The open source communities have no shortage of generous people! We have nine projects ready to go and 28 wonderful mentors to work with students. I&rsquo;d like to welcome back returning mentors from Reviewboard, MarkUs, Umple, Mylyn, and Firefox Code Coverage. I&rsquo;d especially like to welcome Greg Mierzwinski who is returning as a mentor for Firefox Code Coverage after working on it as a UCOSP student.
We have four new projects from Mozilla: Firefox 3D Z-index Tool, TaskCluster-Pulse, Pontoon, and FlyWeb.</p>

      <p>Planning is in full swing for the fall term. Students and faculty are definitely thinking about September. Looking at our registration form we already have about half the number of students we expect signed up and more are starting to roll in.
Our fall code sprint will be held at the Mozilla offices in downtown Toronto. Their community space is a great place to work, and Mike Hoye and his team are excellent hosts.</p>

      <p>Year in Review We had another great year with UCOSP, thanks to the generous sponsorship from Google and the support of the CACS/AIC.
Thirty-five students attended the September code sprint in Vancouver at the beautiful UBC campus. Our wonderful long term project mentors once again created a great experience for our students. We welcomed back ReviewBoard, Formulize, BB 10/Phonegap, MarkUs, and Umple.
We were thrilled to welcome back Dethe Elza with Waterbear, and Jim Parry with CodeIgniter.</p>

      <p>&ndash; Adam Wong
Hey everyone, now that I am halfway through my UCOSP project, I would like to take some time to reflect and share some of my experiences. I have had the honor of working with three other talented students from the University of British Columbia as well as with two friendly and intelligent Mozilla employees in the Jupyter Notebook project.
So what exactly is a Jupyter Notebook, and why should you really care?</p>

      <p>(An experience report from Yorie Nakayama)
If you are developing with python on Django, or on any frameworks that employ the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm, you might come across whether there is a way to easily visualize all the models and their dependency relationships in your application as a diagram. Models are central to most applications using MVC, and being able to glance at the structure of models and their relationships to each other greatly helps any developer beginning to hack on the codebase.</p>

      <p>As we prepare for the next group of students who will start in January, we are seeing some turnover in the project offerings for UCOSP, so I&#8217;d like to welcome the newcomers and thank the project mentors from the past term.
The project mentors for Waterbear, CodeIgniter, and Mylyn are all based in Vancouver which makes it more difficult to attend a code sprint in Toronto. It has been great working with Dethe, James and Sam, and I hope we will have a chance to work with you again in the future!</p>

      <p>Xing Zeng from UToronto who has been working on the CodeIgniter project checks in on this term. I am working on the CodeIgniter Project. More specifically, our team is spending most of our time in developing Netbeans plugin for CodeIgniter developers.
CodeIgniter is a light-weight PHP framework, loosely based on the popular Model-View-Controller development pattern. It is the 4th most widely-used PHP framework throughout the Internet[1]. Despite this, there has been no IDE plugin for it on any major IDE, where lots of other PHP frameworks, including the famous Symphony and the not so famous Nette2, all have IDE plugins specifically designed to work with the features of their library.</p>

      <p>Karin Ng from the University of Toronto gives us her experience working with UMPLE this term.
Umple merges UML modeling and programming to facilitate Model-Oriented Programming. The models include class diagrams, state machines, and composite structures. My primary project is to create a generator that takes in current Umple semantics to produce GraphViz (open source graph visualization software) code of an entity-relationship diagram. After I have completed the generation, I hope to look into refactoring all the generators and extracting commonalities into a generation library.</p>

      <p>Andrew Hong from the University of Toronto gives us his impressions of the program.  It has been almost two full months in the Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects (UCOSP) program and now that I look back, it has been an amazing experience. If you are reading this, you probably have an idea of what the UCOSP program is about and are looking to find out more. UCOSP is basically where you get to work on a distributed open source project for a semester with a team of students and mentors.</p>

I had an enjoyable and rewarding time working on the project, and experienced real-world software engineering practices and open source collaboration.
One thing I really appreciate about the BB10 PhoneGap project is its tasks. It has a list of independent tasks, and each one requests to build a complete plugin project of a useful feature, for example, zip file extraction and compression, barcode scanner, and system dialog.</p>

      <p>Faraz Sherwani from the University of Waterloo shares his thoughts on the UCOSP program this term.  Why you may want to UCOSP     Meet, work with and be mentored by some really smart people in your field.   Learn a new language, or set of tools that a particular project uses, but that you are not too familiar or experienced with.   Learn the details of a particular source control workflow that you may not have used in the past.</p>

      <p>Yanjia Xin from the University of Waterloo summarizes her UCOSP experience:
I have grown quite a bit since I started working on Review Board. Prior to Review Board, I rarely did anything on web development, touched a little bit HTML and Javascript. I was a beginner in python, and never actually seen any Django projects before. Throughout this term, all those things have changed. Here are some tips I would like to share with all of you.</p>

      <p>Peter from UofT checks in:
ReviewBoard is a web service which facilitates code review amongst developers
within a repository (Git, SVN, etc). The project I am working on is an
implementation of TogetherJS, an extension (or plugin) that organizations can
choose to install within their instance of ReviewBoard. TogetherJS is a
javascript library that allows multiple users to discuss a webpage through
text and voice chat and live cursor interaction. A demo is available here.</p>

      <p>Olessia Karpova from the University of Toronto summarizes her UCOSP experience:
First steps
The first step after being accepted into the program is picking the project. This year there were over 20 projects, how do you choose the right one? This is something you’ll be working on for a considerable amount of time – think about what your priorities are: is it to dive deeper into a topic you are already comfortable with?</p>

MediaWiki is a versatile wiki software package written in PHP that powers websites where users write collaboratively. It is used in a variety of applications, from Wikipedia to the online documentation of Arch Linux. The extension architecture of MediaWiki allows it to adapt to the needs of different applications: while the core portion of the software is already powerful, it can be augmented with modular extensions.</p>

Flying has never been a joy of mine, however, we made it here in one piece
so I guess I can&#8217;t really complain. I met up with another UCOSPer, purely
by coincedence, on the way down. It turns out we both fit the bill of

      <p>This term&#8217;s code sprint was held at Facebook Headquarters in California. Holding the sprint outside of Canada was a first for UCOSP, but it enabled us to join up with 110 students from several US and International schools that were also holding a similar weekend hackfest on the Facebook campus. This term 43 students from 19 Canadian universities are working on 7 different projects. Photos to follow.</p>

Umple is a powerful tool for Model-Oriented Programming. It allows the
programmer to work on a more abstract level by generating code automatically for attributes, associations and state machines. This eliminates the writing of a lot of _boiler plate code_ when developing and speed up the development process. We are so confident in Umple&#8217;s code generating capabilities that *we even write Umple using Umple* 🙂</p>

      <p>UCOSP 2012 is off and running following a successful code sprint in Kitchener Waterloo last weekend. We have 58 students from 16 different Canadian universities working on 8 projects this term and from everything I saw and heard, the sprint was a great success.
The UCOSP program operates under the Canadian Association of Computer Science (CACS/AIC). Michelle Craig, chair of the UCOSP steering committee, attended the CACS/AIC Chairs meeting in the spring and once again promoted the program, so we are able to welcome even more universities to the program.</p>

Hi! I’m Wilson Yeung and I’m in my last semester at Simon Fraser University where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computing Science. I joined the Review Board team because an opportunity was presented to the computing undergrads at SFU to join UCOSP. Despite having high expectations, I am still surprised at how fulfilling this experience is. Being enclosed in a controlled learning environment at university, I was excited to work on something that had real life applications and meaning to the outside world.</p>

My experience with UCOSP has been very fulfilling thus far. I’ve met a lot of great people, and have enjoyed working on the Review Board project more than I ever would have expected. One of my favourite aspects of the program is the feeling that your contributions are significant; The code you write is distributed to and executed by real users. This is in stark contrast to the usual work which is done in university.</p>

Recently I have been introduced to two new development tools; GitHub and ReviewBoard. In this blog I am going to talk a little bit about each and my experience with using these tools.
GitHub is one of the largest code hosting applications, which provides an ease of sharing codes online and allows other coders to contribute to different projects. GitHub has several advantages; it fuses the best features of a social networking site with a code-sharing forum.</p>

We all know Review Board is great for allowing a distributed team to effectively ensure only high quality, standards complaint code is integrated into the end product. But what else makes Review Board great?
From my experiences on the team I can safely say it gives new developers a leg up on the learning curve when starting. I was able to leverage Review Board to quickly learn exactly what I should, and should not be doing in my code.</p>

      <p>Hi everyone,
Just a quick status update from the EOL team here: we have met each other at last at the fantastic UCOSP code sprint in Toronto!
At the code sprint, we learned a lot of things. Our awesome mentors Dmitry and Lisa started off by teaching us how to use Git and instructing us on the proper commit workflow for the EOL project hosted on Github.
We then spent the remainder of the code sprint setting up our development environments.</p>

      <p>Lots of things are happening behind the scenes as we gear up for UCOSP again this fall. Faculty across Canada are recruiting students, we are busy trying to collect a few more projects and finalize the ones we have tentatively arranged, and we are still looking for more sponsors.
We are very grateful to Google for agreeing to be our major sponsor for the second year in a row. We are also grateful for the enthusiastic support of the CACS/AIC (the association of Canadain computer science chairs).</p>

      <p>Now that we have reached the middle of the term it is a great time for a blog post in order to see where we stand.&nbsp;
 Since the beginning of the term, we got all introduced to the POSIT app and got familiar with it&#8217;s components and architecture. In order to warm up, each of us started to look into some re-factoring and testing tasks. We identified few issues that were worth tackling but were also minor enough such that we could accomplish them in a short amount of time.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s been a while since the code sprint and everyone is settling down nicely. Apart from other courses, there haven&#8217;t been any major road blocks the MarkUs team has faced. Everyone is using the resources they can to breeze through the problems with their various issues. Thanks to our amazing mentors, many of us have overcome the problems we&#8217;ve encountered so far. The IRC channel provides a perfect place for efficient question and answer sprints while the mentors try to help everyone who&#8217;s stuck.</p>

Ultimately this will restrict the functionality on the website (such as uploads) until a user has logged in.</p>

Since this project was conceptualized and named in early October, we have made great strides in designing a user and application programming interface for visualizing activity on CoRAL (Collaborative Review Analysis of Literature) and to be used in tandem with the Fab4Browser. CoRAL/Fab4 is an academic publication browser that allows users to comment, discuss and annotate academic papers. It was designed to facilitate discussion and development of ideas and encourage collaboration and sharing of viewpoints between different experts of the scientific community.</p>

If you’ve been following this blog, you’ll know that the team has been working very hard on their projects. But I’ll bet those status reports can be a bit cryptic sometimes.
So here’s my take on where we are so far, in no particular order:
 Hongbin has been working on an extension that will allow communication between Review Board and various bug-trackers.</p>

      <p>A guest post by team member Todd Ritchie.
The Basie/Pinax team has been working on a mailing list module for the next iteration of Basie. This module was designed with the intent of being able to decouple it from Basie and use it with any Pinax application. We started from scratch and during the code sprint we managed to get creation of mailing lists working, addition of subscribed e-mail lists, and walking of subscribed e-mails so that we can send messages.</p>

      <p>The CoRAL team (formerly known as fab4) has been making great progress on our task.
The task is to develop a visualization service for the fab4 browser project, whose objective is to support communities of readers by allowing them to share their comments on the documents they read. The original fab4 project simply provides a canvas on which to place and view annotations of different types on a document.
In our work, we assume that the fab4 user community consists of researchers either reviewing papers for the purpose of writing surveys and related-research sections of new publications or for the purpose of accepting/rejecting papers submitted to a conference.</p>

      <p>This weekend, over 50 students and project mentors gathered in Toronto for this semester&#8217;s code sprint.

Why go through all the trouble and expense of bringing students together to a single physical location to work on their projects? Isn&#8217;t the point of UCOSP to teach students to work in a distributed environment? Yes, but from experience, we&#8217;ve found that when teams are able to meet even once, the odds of success are dramatically increased.</p>

Khushboo has been wrestling with git and getting her branch(s) to push properly. Some very informative posts can be found on her blog. She also continues creating build scripts for other python packages.
Fatima:
Fatima has been working on getting branch support in for Mecurial checkouts in pony-build, to go along with the new changes, she has also been working on tests. You can read up on all her research into the subject as well as her progress over at her blog.</p>

      <p>Today marks the last day of classes at the University of Waterloo, and so ends the official portion of the UCOSP project for Tessa, Wendy, and myself. During our last meeting on April 1st, we tied some loose ends on our patches and discussed our experiences in the project. I will save the details for the final reports, but we all agreed that we&#8217;d like to continue contributing to Mercurial as time permits.</p>

      <p>&#8220;The real challenge of GSoC is not the coding, it&#8217;s learning to work with a community,&#8221; wrote Matt Mackall to the Mercurial mailing list a couple days ago with regard to the upcoming Google Summer of Code projects: http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2010-April/030996.html
I believe this applies equally well to us: the real challenge of UCOSP is not the coding, it&#8217;s learning to work with a community. This is especially true for the Mercurial team because we are working with such a large, established, global community of developers.</p>

      <p>Apologies this is coming late, I didn&#8217;t notice I was set as the blog poster for this week!
It seems like several of us are having difficulties with unit tests, with myself and Zach having trouble getting working unit tests off the ground, and Wei Xian adding some polish to his previous unit tests.
Also, Tim and I are feeling the crunch of other courses so haven&#8217;t been productive over the last week.</p>

      <p>For some of us on the Mercurial crew next week is the closing chapter of the UCOSP adventure. Tessa, Wendy and Anton from Waterloo will be finishing their term, and with that their contributions to Mercurial as part of the program. That&#8217;s not to say they&#8217;ll be done with Mercurial for good—the general consensus is that we all had a great time. Paul and myself still have until mid-April to get the remainder of our work submitted.</p>

Drag and Drop
&#8211; Cory is still plugging away at implementing this, as it is not a small task. If anyone is interested in looking at it and providing feedback, it would be beneficial.
&#8211; He is also wondering if anyone has priorities or features in mind in regards to drag and drop.

      <p>Brenda Status  Reworked the patch for Bug 303426 to fix the problem Wayne noted. I found the solution to Bug 303581 and included it in this patch as the code greatly overlapped and the problems were related. Made note of this in Bug 303581. Started investigating into Bug 303420 (Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu) to see how this should be done. I have the main outline coded, but I&#8217;m still figuring out how to pull in the refactoring functionality to use in conjunction with this code.</p>

Initial expectations:
 Apply what I&#8217;ve learned from courses and work. Check. Explore techniques that I haven&#8217;t had the chance to practice at work. E.g. Personas, but that&#8217;s on the back-burner. Collaborate closely with the developers. See below.  What&#8217;s going well:
 I think the code sprint at the beginning of the term has been invaluable in terms of motivation.</p>

      <p>For many of the same reasons raised below, I haven&#8217;t been as productive as I had expected; in particular, this has largely resulted from the intersection between front-heavy term workloads and the various bureaucratic demands of graduation/full-time employment.

      <p>As contrasted with some of my students, I&#8217;m fairly happy with the amount of coding work they&#8217;ve gotten done. I think this is largely because I had more realistic expectations coming in to the course. After 15 years in industry I&#8217;ve come to realize that there&#8217;s a whole lot more to fixing bugs than fixing the bug, and the other stuff is what takes the time. Stuff like figuring out what&#8217;s going wrong, and how the code fits together, writing tests, getting it reviewed, fixing the things the reviewer points out, getting it committed, and (hopefully) writing up their weekly status reports.</p>

      <p>It has been a very good learning experience for me to work with Mercurial team so far.
What I learned:
To be honest, I had no experience in python coding or Mercurial at the beginning of the semester. I was terrified that I had no idea how to start my worm-up project tagmerge extension at the code sprint. Thankfully, Benjamin was really patient with me and guided me where to start off.</p>

this is my midterm report for Basie project.
The first part of the project was to fix bugs to have a good representation for PyCon. Version 0.6 is now released and we can now work on 0.7 release.
I&#8217;m working with Guillaume Simard for 0.7, our goal is to add front-end test for the entire application. To do that, we will use Selenium. The setup to use Selenium is praticaly completed and we have 7 weeks left to write tests for every apps in Basie.</p>

      <p>This is my midterm update of the Flight Simulator project
As the team lead on the student side for the first time in my life, I can feel the responsibility and challenge from my role all the time. I am basically using agile methodology I experienced in my previous coop work team and it turned out that everything worked out quite well. Tickets are opened and closed on time, and deliverables are officially accepted by IBM on the delivering date, so we can tell that the team is well on-track.</p>

      <p>The progress of the term is going well since the deliverables are completed on time and the IBM folks are satisfied with them. The most important feeling in this project is that, although we are physically in three different cities, two different time zones, we are able to keep up the communication and plans. Each of us are assigned with a task, complete it on time, and merge all of our work into one deliverable, and this cycle goes on, even though all of us are busy with other things at the same time.</p>

      <p>This term’s version of IDE4EDU is much the same as last terms. The output of our three students (Brenda, Cory and Miles) has been comparable to last term’s effort and Wayne and I are happy with their consistent progress. On the communication side, there has not been as much online traffic as last term, but that has not seemed to prevent the group from moving forward.
Like last term, the main issue IDE4EDU faces is the action of committing code.</p>

      <p>I have to say I&#8217;m disappointed with my progress so far &#8211; not so much in terms of understanding the code and bug fixing, but more in terms of turning my lines working code into accepted patches (and all the communication and time management that goes along with that).
Code
Toronto was a great opportunity to learn about the deep inner workings of the Mozilla codebase (an opportunity which, considering the size and scope of the code, was invaluable).</p>

      <p>Wow, has this semester ever gone by fast &#8212; I can&#8217;t believe that we only have six weeks left until the end of term! Working on Basie has been quite the learning experience. I had never worked on an open-source project before starting on this project, and I knew very little about Django. Over the past two months I&#8217;ve learned a tremendous amount about both. It&#8217;s been great getting to know the tools of the trade (ticketing systems, the reviewboard, etc) and working as part of a team.</p>

      <p>Here is my midterm report for the Data Center Flight Simulator project.
At first we were not sure about what we had to do and what IBM was waiting from us. Fortunately it became clearer by the end of the first week with the help of Matthew, from IBM.
Since the beginning of this project we have mostly investigated how to detect and create saturations from different part of the system using the DB2 database.</p>

      <p>The term started off with an earlier Code Sprint kickoff than last term and this definitely helped get things in motion much quicker and allowed us to address problems much earlier on which I found was most helpful this term as our team ran into a series of dependent environment setup issues that delayed a lot of the work. The goals and requirements of the project were fairly vague at first, but despite these early setbacks, I found that the team I am working with this term (compared to my last term with UCOSP) is a lot more self-driven and willing to communicate, ask questions, keep each other updated and help each other out.</p>

      <p>Working on Basie has been a blast! And the team, they&#8217;re really a first-class bunch. Well, to quote Greg, Basie has seen a &ldquo;flurry of activity&rdquo; in the recent weeks as we prepared to debut Basie 0.6. We have all done tremendous work fixing many outstanding bugs, discovering new issues and solutions, refactoring a bunch of code, and redesigning the interface.
These past few months I&#8217;ve worked mostly on fixing old issues and redesigning the Dashboard.</p>

      <p>Never worked on an open-source project before, it has proven to be challenging for me to run different scripts and commands in an open-source environment. It has been a huge learning curve for me to adjust to open-source programs when I was babied all these years by GUI applications and Windows. Although we are half-way through the term, we still have a lot of development work to do. The setup of the environment took awhile as there are so many configurations that are required for this project.</p>

      <p>The time is running so fast that it is already the middle of the term. It has been a quite exciting time for me since I joined UCOSP, joined my team – MarkUs. After 2 months work with our team, I feel more confident in working for MarkUs.
What I have learned
For the technique aspect, I am more familiar with Rails development. I have learned setting up the workspace for Rails, basic Ruby syntax and basic way of Rails development.</p>

      <p>Summary:
Things are going slower than expected. I thought I would be able to get so much more done. The first few weeks were spent on my first changelist. My expectation was to be done with the first week [8]. I have learned tons about Ruby, Rails, Rails plugins and javascript. I am currently working on replaced the AJAX pagination with serverside pagination on the submissions page. Afterwards, I will be working on the detailed view for the submissions page.</p>

      <p>My Goal and Expectation
My work at Thunderbird is mainly to fix a bug regarding to the “Reply To List” feature. By working on this bug, I am expecting to get myself further exposed to real industrialized products based on my computing science knowledge gained from previous school and work experience.
What I have done so far and What have I learned
First of all, I have to say that my ability to analyze problems is greatly enhanced through working on Thunderbird, which is a complicated software comprising million lines of code.</p>

      <p>Hi all,
The first few weeks has been simply non-productive since we had to find a way to install everything on our machines. No useful documentation was available for us to make this quick so we had to tweak files to make everything works. What&#8217;s nice about that is that now, documentation exists because we took the time to write some detailed tutorials for every OS (Windows/Linux/Mac). It&#8217;s always nice of being able to work on his favorite OS and not having to reboot to do so.</p>

      <p>Expectations, Status &amp; Progress
Coming into this UCOSP project course, my ultimate goal was to be able to utilize the human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) design knowledge that I’ve acquired from both school and work to enhance the usability of MarkUs. Through this experience, I’m hoping to solidify my understanding of various usability concepts and familiarize myself with more projects out there.
Up until now, I feel that I’m on track with the work that I’m doing with MarkUs.</p>

      <p>Few months ago,when I first joined Pony-build, I was excited and eager to learn more about this project in particular and open-source in general. I knew my limited experience might make my progress slower than expected but I was determined to learn more no matter what.
I couldn&#8217;t join the UCOSP community for the &#8220;Code Sprint&#8221; in Canada; however, I started to communicate with the project lead Titus C. Brown and the rest of the group via Skype to make the initial system set ups.</p>

      <p>My overall progress is a bit slower than I expected, because environment setup took me too long in early February. But I have started implementing actual code and current progress seems good.
The main difficulty I have had so far is setting up development and testing environment. A large scale open source project such as geotools requires me to install and configure a lot of programs before development starts. Therefore, this setup progress is time-consuming and requires attention to detail.</p>

      <p>I am not proud to say this, but my performance on Thunderbird could have been better.
Am I behind?
 Yes, I am at least three weeks behind the schedule I set for myself. I would have liked to submit my first patch by the end of January, but I ended up doing that only in the third week of February. At the start of the term, I broke down the feature I was responsible for implementing into reasonably sized pieces and estimated that each piece will take approximately 1-2 days to implement.</p>

      <p>When we set out at the beginning of UCOSP, my goal was for us to contribute significantly to Mercurial by the end of the semester. How well have we accomplished that goal so far?
At the beginning of the semester, all of the students were given small, self-contained bug fixes and features that we&#8217;d discovered people wanted over the course of developing Kiln, mostly in the form of Mercurial extensions. Four of these were quickly completed: cedit, a command-line-based way to configure Mercurial; cache-annotations, which makes annotating files repeatedly ridiculously fast; globexclude, which allows you to exclude files based on their glob pattern when doing conversions to Mercurial; and caseguard, which warns you when you are committing files that have names that will prevent Mac and Windows users from using your repository.</p>

      <p>We had a brief meeting today; here is what we discussed.
Present: Miles, Cory and Brenda
Absent: No one
Naming
&#8211; Educlipse (or EduEclipse) is short, concise and demonstrates what it is – a version of Eclipse meant for education.
&#8211; Eclipse IDE for Education fits well with the naming schemes for other Eclipse products.
&#8211; The consensus between us still seems to be Educlipse or EduEclipse, however.
Templates
&#8211; Discussed opening an extension point for the templates; we shouldn’t need more than 2-4 templates ourselves.</p>

      <p>Hi everyone, this is my midway update.  Well.. technically this is my midway update. However, since I&#8217;m a student at Université Laval we started our semester slightly later than the rest of Canada and it&#8217;s going to be over by the end of April. I plan on working on Basie until the end of my term so that means that I still have more time in front of me to get things done.</p>

      <p>Brenda Status  Looked further into the use of plugin_customization.ini for setting the default perspective and it seems this file is created when we compile a standalone RCP App. Cory posted details on its use in Bug 299869. Submitted bug reports 303425, 303426 and 303427, related to the Class and Package wizards. Submitted a patch that alters my previous patch for hiding packages and source folders so that all source folders are hidden, not just those named &ldquo;src&rdquo; Looked into the other issue Wayne found with this patch (project explorer view not always updating), but haven&#8217;t come to a solution yet.</p>

      <p>warm-up I&#8217;ve used open-source software for the last 7 years (which is feels like a blip in Internet time). I was aware since the beginning that these projects thrive on contributions from people all over the world. And I knew that these tools had bugs and had roadmaps with desired features waiting on some developer to tackle. But before UCOSP I&#8217;ve never made a solid contribution to anything. I always imagined expert programmers are the only ones that have a business getting involved in these projects and submitting patches and extensions.</p>

      <p>The first half of the semester has flown by quickly. Like last semester, I&#8217;m really enjoying being a part of the MarkUs team! It was nice to already have my development environment from last semester all set and ready to go for this semester. Since I didn&#8217;t have to spend any time on setup, I was able to jump back into the code right away. I&#8217;ve found that things make a lot more sense to me now than they did around the same time last semester.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with both my progress so far and the progress of our entire team (Mercurial). As Anton and Tessa have mentioned, we hit a bit of a slow period recently with bfiles but I think that&#8217;s natural. We had an exceptionally productive first month and a bit (largely thanks to the code sprint!). Every person on our team contributed non-trivial extensions that tangibly increased the usability of Mercurial. I think that is something we should be very proud of.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m definitely feeling better about working on projects with _huge_ codebases like Thunderbird. I&#8217;m currently working on a patch to add a &#8220;Reopen last tab&#8221; button to Thunderbird. I&#8217;m finally feeling like I know my way around Thunderbird&#8217;s tab management code. I submitted a patch a couple weeks ago and got some feedback, and I&#8217;ve done most of what the patch suggested. The only thing left to do before I submit my patch again is to figure out why the UI tests sometimes pass and sometimes fail on my computer (even without my patch applied!</p>

      <p>This semester has not been as productive as I would have liked. I set out to fix a single bug in Thunderbird that I thought would be cool to do. Before I left code sprint I found I had to fix another bug first to add support to fix the original. Doing so would put my code in the base Mozilla library, which was used for Firefox also, so I thought this was exceptionally cool.</p>

      <p>Working on Basie has been a great learning experience. There are always plenty of things to work on and learn from. The people are also great, I feel privileged to be able to work with a group of students who are so hard working and care so much about the project.
Like any project the ramp up time is the most painful. I feel that the ramp up time for Basie has been longer than I had hoped.</p>

      <p>Simply put, I&#8217;m dissatisfied with my performance with MarkUs.  Up until now, I&#8217;ve been doing what could be considered the bare minimum of work to get a passing &#8220;grade&#8221; for UCOSP. This is my final school term which means I&#8217;m looking to the future a lot this term, searching for full time employment. While I&#8217;ve been very successful in this endeavour to tell the truth, it does mean that certain trade offs have been made which have not been to MarkUs&#8217; benefit.</p>

      <p>So far, Eclipse4Edu has been a very useful experience for me. It’s the first project I’ve worked on where the codebase wasn’t written entirely by myself or by my team of 2-3 students. This has definitely been difficult, but like I said, useful. That combined with the complex framework and abstraction of Eclipse has made tasks that seem relatively trivial suddenly much more time-consuming. I’ve spent a fair amount of time simply looking through the code to familiarize myself with how things were implemented by others that have worked on the project.</p>

      <p>In General, I feel that I started the term out well, but I am presently falling behind my expectations, the “midterm slump” as Benjamin calls it. Within the first few weeks of the term had I submitted my bug fix to the Mercurial mailing list. I hoped that each week I would have completed some tangible amount of coding, whether it be implementing a small bit of functionality or fixing a bug in last week’s work.</p>

      <p>We are half-way through the term and I am enjoying working on Basie a lot. I think in our team we didn&#8217;t have much time to play around and get used to the project because 0.6 was planned soon. This gave a very energetic push in the beginning of the year, and 0.7 is something that pushes me to try my best and do work in time now, when 0.6 is out.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s hard to believe that we are already 1&frasl;2 way through the UCOSP Mercurial project. It has been an amazing learning experience from both a technical and a social point of view.
I started out this project with some limited experience of using Mercurial on my own system. Not only did I have to learn Mercurial in the context of a team, but I also had to put myself in the shoes of users very different from myself.</p>

      <p>A former boss of mine had a sign on the wall in his office that said, &#8220;Out there, right now, someone is writing a queue and getting it wrong.&#8221; What he meant was that if you&#8217;re using a mature language like Java or Python, you should never have to deal with textbook data structures, dates and times, currencies, and other things directly: someone else will always have been there first. So, if you find yourself wrestling with timezones or passwords, fire up your favorite search engine and see what it turns up.</p>

      <p>We spent the first week or two setting things up and play around with DB2. Getting everything we need up and running was a bit tricky, because some major pieces of our toolkit is still in its infancy. Therefore, I spent quite a lot of time documenting my experience on the developer&#8217;s wiki because I believe this would help students that are joining this project in future semesters (as well as our teamates).</p>

      <p>Ingres support for Geotools has been progressing well. However, although we are already half way thru the term, we still have quite a ways to go, so we are beginning to pick up the pace a bit.
Comments and Observations:
&#8211; It seems like there is a lot of overhead and learning compared to the actually size of the code being developed. This has been a great learning opportunity, although it seems like given the learning curve, it would have been more effective if this project was longer than just one term.</p>

      <p>The Ingres/Geotools team finally began work on actual implementation of classes and unit tests for the classes in Geotools at this halfway point.

The Ingres/Geotools team has have a lot to explore in the geospatial world as a toddler would have the world.</p>

      <p>So I guess its that time &#8211; reading week just finished, and we are halfway through the term &#8211; yikes!
In the Eclipse4Edu camp, we are starting to get into the thick of the project. I won&#8217;t lie, it was a pretty slow start&#8230; programming the Eclipse framework is large, complex, and has a layer of abstraction for everything. I like to consider myself fairly competent with Java, but the Eclipse framework almost always has a different (sometimes non-intuitive) alternative solution to everything.</p>

      <p>Meeting Minutes February 19th, 2010
Present: Cory and Brenda
Not present: Miles
Brenda
&#8211; Fixed the patch to Bug 299965 to hide all source folders, not just those named “src”.
&#8211; Is looking into the issue with the project explorer view not updating under the circumstances that Wayne brought up in that bug. It could be that elements are being filtered out and the refresh code is looking at the same list of elements and thus doesn’t know the elements exist.</p>

      <p>Brenda Status  I didn&#8217;t look as much into Scheme as I had intended because in our conference call, Wayne mentioned that the code provided likely can&#8217;t be committed. I decided to look into some other bugs instead. Submitted a patch for Bug 301718 to update the Build Your First Program cheat sheet. Submitted a patch for Bug 299459 to allow the user to rename files (since refactoring has been removed).</p>

You do the Hokey Cokey and you turn around
That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about&#8230;  If you are wondering why Basie team is very cheerful right now, it&#8217;s because we are happy to announce that 0.6 has been released today, very much in time for PyCon. Everyone did her and his share to put this release out of the door and once we take a little break to catch up on our lives and other courses, we&#8217;ll be back working hard to make 0.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m speaking at PyCon on Saturday. The blurb I sent in says:
 What We&#8217;ve Learned From Building Basie
Since September 2008, teams of undergraduates from half a dozen different universities have been building a Django-based replacement for Trac called Basie. This talk will present what they&#8217;ve accomplished and discuss what we&#8217;ve learned about getting junior developers who are juggling half a dozen projects at once to build production-quality code.</p>

      <p>Thanks to a leading question from Pierre Lafayette, Joel Spolsky mentioned us in a recent postcast &#8212; you can listen to the whole thing at http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4403.html (around the 40-minute mark). Yay us! But I do have to correct one thing: in response to Pierre pointing out that $2000 is a bit pricey for most undergrads, Joel says, &#8220;Just ask your university library to get it for you.&#8221; In reality, university library budgets are being slashed left, right, and center; asking them to get anything that isn&#8217;t obviously scholarly isn&#8217;t going to go anywhere 🙁</p>

Max is working on virtual environment and git clone.
Fatima is working on build-coverage and hgClone.
Jacob is working on improving the user interface.
Khushboo is working on build-nose and svn.

      <p>Basie team is working hard to make 0.6 happen; Greg Wilson will be presenting this release at the PyCon 2010 in Atlanta. We seem to inhabit our mailing list, with occasional posts to the Basie blog, where we collect our status reports. Besides fixing many general bugs, we are concentrating on the usability, compatibility, and appearance improvements. Here is a list of status reports that were filed on the Basie blog over the last three weeks, but were missing from the UCOSP blog:</p>

      <p>Brenda Status  Submitted a patch for Bug 299965 so that the default package and src folder are hidden, but explicitly made packages and other source folders are not (for the sake of comparing different approaches to this problem). Submitted a patch for Bug 300388 to rename the Scheme interpreter extension point and schema.  Next Steps  Look into the Scheme perspective more and some of the bugs that have been opened in regards to that (for example, Bugs 299866, 299867 and 299868).</p>

      <p>I posted a link last week to Evan Robinson&#8217;s article explaining why crunch mode doesn&#8217;t work. Coincidentally, Ruben Ortega&#8217;s latest post on the ACM site asks, Why Do Software Developers Tolerate &#8220;Crunch Time&#8221;? His answer is &#8220;progress&#8221;, or at least, developers&#8217; need to feel like they&#8217;re making progress. A couple of paragraphs later, though, he says:
 It is unrealistic to deliver any project without going through some &#8220;Crunch time.&#8221;</p>

No matter what you say, she&#8217;ll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows better.

      <p>For the full update, check out our project blog.
Everyone is starting to feel the pressure of their classes this semester, but despite this several of us are close to submitting our first patch. A common theme is difficulty understanding how to work with the Mozilla platform, but learning how to work with someone else&#8217;s code is good experience for us all.</p>

      <p>After our conference call today, here&#8217;s a summary of the current situation of what I&#8217;ve been working on, as well as the direction this aspect of the project is going:
The past couple weeks, I&#8217;ve been working on hiding references to packages (in the project explorer, as well as buttons and menus that allow the user to create a new package).
The concept that is being discussed is that we don&#8217;t want the user to work in Java Lite for the first month or so of their course, then come to the point where they switch to the regular Java perspective and become overwhelmed by the sudden presence of many tools they have not been introduced to.</p>

      <p>We have made substantial progress towards getting our initial contributions ready for submitting to the mercurial-devel mailing list. This has been a week of testing and code reviews where we all learned something new about Mercurial and writing python code in general.
To summarize, you can expect the following extensions to be submitted to the mercurial mailing list in the next week:
 tagmerge (wendyY): support smart merging of tag files (tags are labels for specific commits or heads)  some fixes and testing, testing, testing  cedit (paulitex): command line and interactive editing of mercurial configuration files with shortcuts for common setup operations  submitted iniparse (external lib) changes upstream documentation, bootstrapping, testing, testing, testing  convert (Tessa): modifying the convert extension to support wildcards in exclude statements  order/precedence of include vs.</p>

If you make it to the bottom, you can see that I haven&#8217;t done very much. Interviews take up so much time! It&#8217;s a good problem to have, but I can&#8217;t help be feel a bit of guilt for pushing MarkUs off to the side for them.
Because of the flexible nature of UCOSP, it&#8217;s possible for me to do this. I&#8217;m just using my banked up hours from the code-sprint sooner rather than later.</p>

      <p>We&#8217;re on track to release Version 0.6 in time for PyCon (which is three weeks away), though we may get there by slapping the word &#8220;beta&#8221; after the &#8220;0.6&#8221; :-). Lots of bugs are being fixed; the ticketing system and milestone display are seeing significant re-work; and we&#8217;re cleaning up code (e.g., pulling Javascript out of HTML pages and putting it in separate files, doing better error reporting). More importantly (at least for me), our work now has a rhythm: stuff is going up on ReviewBoard, getting checked, and getting committed on a pretty regular basis.</p>

Kinda awesome you get to do that for a school project isn&#8217;t it!</p>

      <p>Our project, Mercurial, already announced their participation in Google&#8217;s Summer of Code 2010 via the developer mailing list. I suspect many other projects are doing the same, so even though there&#8217;s no official information on Google&#8217;s own SoC page (yet), you might want to consider preparing your application. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed UCOSP so far and want to continue the experience, GSoC looks like a great avenue to do so.</p>

      <p>Brenda Status  Worked on Bug 299965 to hide packages from the user and posted a patch for the bug. An outstanding issue with this however is that if a project is made outside of Java Lite, the src folder and any packages within it are visible (that is, the patch works for projects made through the Java Lite project wizard only).  Next Steps  Work on the issue mentioned above so that projects made outside the Lite perspective will also hide packages (and the src folder).</p>

      <p>In the flight sim team we relied on skype for all non-verbal communication. It so happened that there is a global skype outage last Thursday right which happed to collide with our weekly team meeting&#8217;s time. (Good thing that we are using IBM&#8217;s conferce call infrastructure for our meeting.) Twitter again proved to be the best way to look for outage information like these &#8211; a quick search for the #Skype hash tag quickly revealed to me that a lot of people are having the same problem, and eventually leads me to the official @Skype Twitter account.</p>

      <p>Since we couldn’t all meet for the Sprint code in Toronto, the first steps into pony-build were to get to speed with the software layout and with working with Git. We were constantly communicating via Skype and our group lead Pr. Titus was very patient and helpful throughout the process.
We first got the software running on Linux via Lyorn then on our own computer (on Windows and Mac). Then our next task was to write one of the client scripts for existing packages, commit it, and push it to Github.</p>

Brenda
&#8211; Working on hiding packages from the user
&#8211; Buttons are easily hidden
&#8211; Has been able to identify which elements of the package explorer are in fact packages, but is stuck on reworking the hierarchy so that the view skips over the package level
Cory
&#8211; Working on hiding menus and toolbars
&#8211; Tried making his own RCP app because it seems this might be the best approach to get rid of unneeded menus and toolbars</p>

      <p>Spent two days out of commission this week after a botched attempt to improve the performance of my integrated Intel 945 chipset ended up freezing gdm on startup. Oops. Several failed attempts to rectify the fault by rolling back xorg.conf (this was not the problem, apparently), one careful repartitioning, a hasty install of Karmic, and countless apt-gets later, I&#8217;m back in action. I note happily that the Karmic repos bundle mercurial 1.</p>

Status  Attended the Code Sprint Spent a lot of time looking through the code, getting an idea for the framework. Reported several bugs for the Java Lite perspective. Tested the patch for Bug 244645 (making a new class in an empty workspace). I agree with it and also posted a new bug (299342) with a patch that does the equivalent for making a new package. However, after the code sprint, we decided that packages should be done away with overall (that is, hidden).</p>

      <p>They say you can&#8217;t manage what you don&#8217;t measure. It&#8217;s equally true of design: if you don&#8217;t know who you&#8217;re designing for, the odds are you&#8217;re going to get something wrong. With that in mind, here are some stats from two universities on browser types:

      <p>The day before the sprint, I knew of nothing about what I should do and what I can do in this project. I woke up at 5 on Friday morning, took a taxi to the bus terminal, got onto Greyhound to Toronto, got lost on our way to Bahen Centre (we were on University and College, 5 minutes away from Bahen, lol) To my surprise, I arrived, and joined a team of people as lost as I was.</p>

      <p>As the dust settles from this years Spring Code Sprint, I am left with some interesting reflections. One, coding for 9 hours straight sure gets hard without proper caffeine intake, maybe an IV drip will be a good investment for the next one. Two, ordering lots of food when someone else is paying is lots of fun, even if you end up walking (waddling?) out with some of it in a bag.</p>

      <p>A couple of students have asked how UCOSP projects are graded. The short answer is, you tell us. Seriously&#8212;talk to your mentors and say, &#8220;These are the things I want to tackle, here&#8217;s why I think they&#8217;d be valuable and how much effort they&#8217;ll require, so please give me grades for X, Y, and Z.&#8221; If your mentor thinks you&#8217;ve chosen things that are too hard, too easy, or not particularly useful, the two of you can negotiate back and forth until you settle on something that makes you both happy.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;d like to thank Greg, all the mentors/organisers and the nice people from IBM (especially Matthew) for everything they have done for us. They have obviously put lots of effort and their spare time into this and I think we should all give them a big round of aplause.
So.. the code sprint is now officially over.. and here is what I think..
What I liked:
 Having the chance to meet everyone before we actually start coding turns out to be extremely valuable.</p>

      <p>The coding sprint is winding down here in Toronto, but the Mercurial UCOSP project is just getting into the groove. As people are making their way home &#8211; across the street or across the country &#8211; I want to take a few minutes to expand on Alex&#8217;s post and summarize this weekend.
Working on a mature project like Mercurial has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, we have a real successful project to learn from, but at the same time, it is hard to find work that is both accessible to a newbie and has real impact on the project.</p>

      <p>This weekend, we focused on finding the main aspects of the program that we think need working on and deciding where to go with each one. Specifically, there was the simplification of toolbars and menus to cater to beginner programmers, comparing the Java versus Scheme parts of the project and approaching the open bugs that have already been identified. Also we experimented with the program from a first year student standpoint to determine what is and isn&#8217;t necessary and went from there.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve already met many of you in person, but I guess I should a bit about myself here too.
I&#8217;m in my final term of my computer science degree at University of Waterloo and I&#8217;m working on Mercurial this term.
At my last co-op job, I was feeling disheartened because the project I was working wouldn&#8217;t have any impact on anything anyone would ever actually use. So, when I heard about UCOSP I was excited about the possibility of working on something real and useful for a change.</p>

      <p>During this Code Sprint we focused on a few improvements to Mercurial that make it easier and safer to use. Each of the tasks we worked on was scoped such that only one developer was needed, but this gave everyone a chance to dive head-first into the Mercurial codebase at their own pace. For some (myself included) this is also the first serious project in Python, and these two days were a great opportunity to ask lots of questions.</p>

      <p>Hello!
So our project involves making Eclipse soft and fuzzy. So we are trying to hide 90% of Eclipse from the beginner programmer. Currently we are working on trying to hide menu commands and tool bar items in a non-random manner. The challenge is that we are not really creating new code (which there is tonnes of material about) but trying to find the sections of the Eclipse code that we need to modify or overrule and there&#8217;s a lot of Eclipse code to sift through.</p>

      <p>Hello everyone,
I&#8217;m Jean (or John, as you like) and I&#8217;ll be working on the Data Center Flight Simulator. I&#8217;m a 4th year student in software engineering at Université Laval and that&#8217;s my last semester, which is great!
Like several students here, that&#8217;ll be my first experience in an open-source project and it&#8217;ll certainly be a new challenge for me. The reason I&#8217;m here is because I wanted to work on something different for my last school&#8217;s project.</p>

      <p>This message is for SFU students who are both in UCOSP and CMPT 376 W. Given that I&#8217;m your instructor for both UCOSP and 376, I know there&#8217;s a schedule conflict between the code sprint this weekend and Assignment 1 for 376, due Monday. I&#8217;ll extend the A1 deadline for 376 students also participating in the code sprint: You have until Wednesday Jan 20 to turn in Assignment 1. That way you can focus single-mindedly on the sprint.</p>

      <p>Hi everyone !
My name is François Fournier ( call me frank, it&#8217;s shorter and easier ! ). I will complete my formation in software engineering next fall. It will be my first contribution to an open-source project, all of my experience in software development came from classes or summer job.
Basie is a good project for me because it will help me to continue my learning of python.
I hope we will have fun during all this semester and I will see you all at Toronto this week-end.</p>

      <p>Hello.
My name is Denis. I&#8217;m a third year computer science (AI) at the University of Toronto. I will be working with the Mercurial team.
I chose the Mercurial project because I didn&#8217;t want to be involved in any academia-related projects, and I wanted to work on something with a large number of users. Also, C and python are my favourite languages, and it is sponsored by Fog Creek Software, which seems like a great company, so it would be nice to get on their good side.</p>

 Communicate early and frequently. Make your work visible (if we can&#8217;t see what you&#8217;re doing, we can&#8217;t help you). It&#8217;s your responsibility to manage your time and make steady progress.</p>

My name is Fatima-Zohra Cherkaoui, I’m a junior (3rd year) from Minnesota State University, majoring in Software engineering. I will be working on the Pony-Build project for the upcoming semester.
I’m very excited to take part in this open-source project which will be for sure an inspiring learning experience.
So far, I have been using mostly C-related languages C++ and Java, but I have lately learned a functional language “Scala” (used in Twitter) and “Boo” (a Python-like language) which has given me the chance to broaden my view on programming from the traditional imperative style to the functional one.</p>

      <p>A couple of people have emailed to ask why their university isn&#8217;t included in the list of who&#8217;s taking part in Winter 2010. The answer is that we haven&#8217;t been able to find a faculty member willing to anchor things there, or that no students have stepped forward (usually because they&#8217;re already in year-long capstone projects). All hope is not yet lost, though: we&#8217;d be happy to hear from anyone who&#8217;d like to join us, even at this late date.</p>

Admittedly, I have not had a fraction of the time that I thought I would have at the beginning of the semester, leaving me with a laundry list of work that still needs to be done on Ingres.

      <p>Thumbs up: They way the students on the project came together and worked as a team, holding IRC meetings, sharing emails and conference calls.
Thumbs down: The project started off slower than expected, in part to the existing infrastructure and rules of interaction with Eclipse projects and with me becoming familiar with supervising such a unique student course experience.</p>

      <p>First off, thank you to Greg and all the profs and TAs that made this project course possible. It was definitely a unique and invaluable experience that I believe all students should consider in their undergraduate years.
What worked:
I&#8217;ve been working full-time as a programmer for 3 years now and I wish I had taken this course during my undergrad as this course is extremely applicable to real life work practices.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m not the first to say I learned a lot in this course, which was the point. The most obvious thing I learned was that group projects aren&#8217;t what I expected. Believe it or not, this is my first real group project for school. Working in a team with meetings and dividing up the work according to who volunteers, and trying to figure out other people&#8217;s aptitudes and parse their code and figure out what check-in comments were referring to was an experience.</p>

      <p>Positive: Finally, I can experience working on a real, fully distributed team. Also, I learn a lot of technical stuff from this course. From programming in python to machine learning algorithms. I am also grateful to learn from my colleagues as this is more practical than learning from textbooks.
Negative: I couldn&#8217;t contribute to the team as much as I want to. There are various reasons for this but most notably is due to the complexity and difficulty of the project.</p>

      <p>The Good:
It was nice to learn how people are using tools like FriendFeed to interact directly with their end-users. I know there are a lot of solutions to that specific problem, but my experience with large scale work in the past had only ever been internal projects.
The Bad:
Lack of direction. I understand that this wasn&#8217;t really a problem for a lot of the projects, but I feel that ours suffered it in spades.</p>

      <p>Good
The code sprint. Hands down the most fun part of the course for me (as it was last year), I enjoyed meeting the smart people who make up the Basie team and solving a few key design problems. The Basie team came from all over, and it was a blast.
The Bad
Remote, remote, remote. I know that this business &#8220;can be done from anywhere&#8221;, but it&#8217;s just not the same IMO.</p>

      <p>Whups, it appears I missed the original email on doing this writing assignment&#8211;apologies for it being a bit late!
I&#8217;ll start with my thoughts on the positives for this course first. I really feel I&#8217;ve learned a great deal about working with a distance group on a software project&#8211;something normal CS coursework doesn&#8217;t really prepare one for (and even precious little time is spent in the courses I&#8217;ve taken on working with more or less random groups as well).</p>

      <p>The good cent:
I would definitely say that the best part of my UCOSP experience has been my project &#8220;mentor&#8221;, Blake Winton. I&#8217;m not sure how he put up with my incessant IRC messages at all times of the day Sunday through Saturday. I learned a lot about Mercurial and distributed version control from him, and he was always so chill that I couldn&#8217;t help but want to work on the ISPDB.</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: first of all, know a lot of new friends:) this is most valuable. Second, learn how to cooperation with each other, even we are far away from each other. We use IRC to hold and log team meeting, wiki page to schedule and record our process, bugzilla to keep track of everything. Those tools contribute a lot to the final success of the project. For the technical aspect, I learn the new language flex and use it to create the UI and animation for the front end.</p>

      <p>The Good: I learned a lot about web frameworks (specifically, Django) and jQuery applications from Basie. Without having any web development background, the course allowed me to move at my own pace while still absorbing lots of information that I will likely retain for future employment opportunities. Not only that, but the reference gained by doing such a project is certainly one of the best ways to get your foot in the door (here&#8217;s looking at you, Greg ;)).</p>

      <p>thumbs up: Getting the opportunity to work with so many interacting technologies was a challenge. It forced me to take care with the documentation I have been preparing, and given me some inspiration as to ways that documentation could be organized better.
thumbs down: Meetings were often canceled and it was hard to set attainable personal goals.
All in all, I feel the course has been helpful. It was extremely frustrating at times because I felt like I was spending so much time dealing with installation problems and not always knowing what work was necessary to get to the next step.</p>

      <p>Up: One of the best parts for me was learning what a great thing constructive criticism is. I practically look forward to a denied patch because of the amount of feedback and the opportunity for improvement. This was refreshing after just getting a discouragingly low mark.
Down: The delay of email sometimes causes all progress to halt because I just didn&#8217;t know how to proceed. This would cause breaks and dry spells, something I found tough to deal with.</p>

      <p>Good: I had a real good experience. It was a challenge still because we have not finished yet, but we learned how to solve problems that can apply to real world challenges in the computer science field. Talking with the Ingres community via email and IRC channel was real helpful.
Bad: We should communicate more often via UCOSP. We all work in separate ways with the Ingress community. We should do a written report every week to reinforce the meetings.</p>

      <p>Thumbs Up: Getting to work on an exploratory project, and seeing what it ended up becoming. WikiDev didn&#8217;t have as defined a goal at the start as most projects, but instead a framework to build on and ideas for where we could take things. After that, it was up to everyone to discuss every week and see where we wanted to go next. This was very enlightening and I enjoyed seeing how the project evolved as pieces were completed and we could see what our ideas were shaping up to look like.</p>

      <p>Apart from the fact that it&#8217;s great to work on a real project. I believe it was invaluable to meet the programmer behind the name at the start of semester. It gave us the chance to not only meet, but perform a little team building as well rather than just a name somewhere in cyberspace. I think that working in a distributed team like this gave us all an experience that we might not get from some IT companies.</p>

      <p>The Good: I, for one, really loved the grad school talk, I think that it was very insightful and I&#8217;m really glad that we got the opportunity to attend it.
The Bad: Can&#8217;t do pair programming when team members are 500km away 🙁 This might be a personal preference but I&#8217;m a huge fan of pair programming, I find development a lot smoother and it&#8217;s also easy to stay motivated and on track.</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: Mozilla&#8217;s strict coding standards and having to submit patches and get our code reviewed was very beneficial. It forces you to pay attention to details and you learn a lot more compared to projects that you hack together last minute and hand in whatever works 🙂
Thumbs down: The tasks our team worked on were pretty individual and so there wasn&#8217;t much collaboration between us.</p>

      <p>[disclaimer: my own opinion, others might not think the same]
The good: the course itself, was a great experience. I think the most valuable thing is that it made me see the challenges software teams face in the real world and why those challenges can&#8217;t be resolved easily sometimes. In addition, I got a chance to work on a great project, and this is the reason I took this course in the first place.</p>

      <p>The official goal of this course is to give students first-hand experience of working in distributed teams. There are lots of other lessons to be learned, though, lessons that can only be learned by working on real applications. Take the performance bug that we just found in Basie, or the seemingly-simple problem of deleting tags (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Neither is a coding bug: in both cases, we&#8217;re going to have to re-think a significant chunk of the system&#8217;s design.</p>

      <p>+1: Collaboration. When the team first started on the project we each worked on bugs that were, for the most part, independent of each other. At around the mid-point of the term, we decided to collaborate more and work on smaller features of a bigger part. This way we were all working toward a common goal. I think we all enjoyed the project much more after we made this decision.</p>

      <p>The good: Quite unequivocally, the students. Each member of the team was eager to learn whatever new language we threw at them (PHP, SQL, Flex/MXML/ActionScript), research solutions to overcome problems they encountered, and ask for assistance when needed. With so many variables in this type of distributed course, including the different experiences and skill sets that comes with being from four separate institutions, having a strong team makes quite a difference.</p>

      <p>Peter Status  Good push to finished work on bug 294015. Decided to use the &ldquo;empty project&rdquo; wizard and the already created Kawa File wizard so that now they can be used to create a project and scheme files. Fixing NULL pointer exception when clicking a file in the explorer. I am pretty sure that it has to do with the fact that I used the Java Lite Explorer and it is looking for the java lite editor which doesn&#8217;t exist in Scheme.</p>

      <p>Thumbs up:
 A chance to make a name on a open source project (&#8220;eclipse&#8221;) The formation that Wayne gave us during the code sprint, We would definitly not have acomplished as much without it. Regular project conference call with the team and Dwight. We managed to work as a real team and set-up a svn and irc channel and have 2 irc meeting each week to give each other a status update.</p>

      <p>I worked on RoboCup and I have to say it didn&#8217;t turn out to be what I expected in the beginning. But I really enjoyed it despite the problems we had (just like any other team this term).
There isn&#8217;t a whole lot of bad things I can say about the csc494 experience. We pretty much lost that month before the Code Sprint because we couldn&#8217;t get an access to the repository.</p>

Alex
&#8211; worked on passing, now it takes into account players from the opposit team
&#8211; it is hard to make 100% accurate passing because of the noise added to the measurements
Next task:
&#8211; work on interception as it is related to passing
Chani
&#8211; fixed code so that now players are using data from the current tick</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: Learning skills and applying them to complete daily project tasks. Like the old saying goes, its like killing two birds with one stone, learning all these new technical/non technical skills that will look pretty good in a resume and completing a great project and getting credits for it, hence making progress in terms of school credits.

      <p>Can&#8217;t believe this is coming to an end already. I&#8217;ve read it before, but let it be the best experience of my undergraduate career too. 🙂
Con : Setting-up
Maybe it&#8217;s just about me (but I don&#8217;t think so), and I know that MarkUs was, by far, not the worst project for that concern, but I didn&#8217;t enjoy the set-up time. One could argue that I never do. One would be right.</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: Great experience working as part of a geographically dispersed team. In all my co-op terms, I&#8217;ve always worked in an office where I could talk to people face-to-face. Now that my experience has broadened, I expect to be a better team player on future software development projects.
Thumbs down: Sporadic time commitments. As a student with 4 other courses, contributing 8-10 hours a week means working sporadically throughout the week when time permits for 1-3 hour chunks at a time.</p>

You are not allowed to repeat something that someone else has said (which is a good incentive to post early :-).
 Apparently posting within the day isn&#8217;t early enough; there are almost two pages already.
I&#8217;d like to echo what Josh said, both the good and the bad. The best courses in my undergraduate have been the ones where I&#8217;ve done &#8216;real&#8217; work, and the more opportunities I have to do such things the better.</p>

      <p>Being a part of the Robocup UCOSP project has been an interesting experience.
First, I&#8217;ll discusses some of the issues with this project. It&#8217;s not actually an open source project, and it&#8217;s not really under development by anyone other then my group members. This is an issue because we didn&#8217;t really get to experience that side of an open source project (ie. being part of a larger picture and lending a hand).</p>

      <p>the good: Working with a good team. We&#8217;ve all had those projects where half the team is asleep or incapable of communicating or just doesn&#8217;t do their work. This was one of those rare group projects where I got to be in a group of students who *wanted* to be there. it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m more used to in the free software world but not in school.
the bad: The chaos. Having our team drop to 5 people threw off a lot of the plans we&#8217;d made at the sprint.</p>

      <p>I have really enjoyed working on MarkUs this semester!
One of the things I liked the best was that our TA and one of the students on our team had both already worked on our project before and they knew both MarkUs and Ruby on Rails inside and out. I think that everyone on the team benefited from their past experiences and it was great to be able to get advice from them and ask them questions throughout the semester.</p>

      <p>I think that this course was a great way to finish off my undergraduate computer science career. I am working on the MarkUs project.
One of the things that I really like about MarkUs is that we have students working on developing a system that students will use to submit assignments. I really wish that we could use a similar methodology to develop a new course registration system (similar to the functionality that PeopleSoft&#8217;s QUEST currently provides for us) and an online course system (similar to ANGEL or WebCT).</p>

      <p>Overall I really enjoyed this course. The one bad thing is that a lot was opened ended. This can be a good thing, however I things like have 2 deliverable dates throughout the semester so we know what we have to accomplish by these dates. Also, making code reviews a requirement and having to turn in a list of goals to accomplish by the end of the code sprint instead of half way through the semester.</p>

      <p>I guess since everyone else started with the goods and finished with the bads. I&#8217;ll go in reverse, leave a better taste in your mouth.
I definitely disliked the fact that I was the only one not in the Eastern time zone, it made it hard for us to get together(virtually). I also found it difficult to chat with the team. By the time I was finished my classes, it was already way late in the Eastern area.</p>

      <p>Up : The great start we had during the code sprint. Wayne Beaton and Dwight Deugo took their time to travel to Toronto and to explain us some really useful concepts and tools. Without them, the team would have started later.
Down : The lack of review from our supervisors. I know that they have a lot to do and that they can&#8217;t hold our hands, but it would have been nice to know if our last submit was good/ok/bad and the reason why they think so.</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: I think code reviews really helped keep everyone on track and to maintain high standards. Mike did a great job reading and commenting on the reviews. It turned out to be a good form of communication between meetings.
Thumbs not so up: As a supervisor, I just couldn&#8217;t keep up, so it was hard to help steer the progress.
Thumbs down: This is a hard format for a postmortem.</p>

      <p>ThumbUp: peer reviews. Peer reviews, at least for the Basie team, was certainly a new type of experience in software development. It promoted communication between the team, getting into each other&#8217;s code, writing code that is good enough for others to look at, and then still getting feedback on how to improve it. It creates a better &#8220;team&#8221; feeling, than simply having a group of people commit to the same source code repository.</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: The code sprint where all students and participating parties gathering face to face provides a precious opportunity for them to know each other, especially on each others&#8217; working style, which helped a lot during the course later on.
Thumbs down: Difference between schools&#8217; expectation from students leads to a significant difference in students&#8217; motivation. If the students are grouped into sub teams working on the same smaller project, we should weight more on continuous communication.</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: Sponsors, I liked the fact that we were able to get further acquainted with large businesses in the computer science field such as Ingres, Tucows, Yahoo, and Rogers Communication. I also agree with Greg&#8217;s point, and it was a good learning experience to work on projects in a different setting and environment.
Thumbs down: Though this may have been expensive, I would&#8217;ve liked to have a UCOSP meeting like the initial sprint at the end of this experience to wrap up the project.</p>

      <p>I am impressed with how much was accomplished in the end. I must say that it is not more than I what was planning/hoping for but at the same time, throughout the course, I had this nagging feeling that things will not come together, and, in the end, we wouldn&#8217;t have anything &#8220;complete&#8221; to show for it. Well we do, and that&#8217;s great!
In spite of notes and discussions and todos and tickets, we still managed to do a few things multiple times (stepping on each other&#8217;s toes).</p>

      <p>Thumbs up: Our great teamwork. Although we are working in a distributed setting, I do find it astonishing how well everything worked out. People are doing a great job in terms of communication.
Thumbs down: Having a pretty tight schedule, I think there was hardly time for one or two developers to go for a spike (i.e. looking into an unknown technological area) and create an example solution to a problem.</p>

      <p>Following up on Greg Wilson&#8217;s post, here&#8217;s another pair of observations about the course; one good and one bad:
Thumbs up: Gaining experience working in a distributed environment is invaluable, but when you add on top of that the fact that we are producing some great open source software, you have a winning combination. Some of us have experience in the industry through co-op and other programs at our universities, but at least for me working on open source was a completely different experience.</p>

      <p>We&#8217;re coming up on the end of term, so it&#8217;s time to start thinking about what went right and what went wrong. I&#8217;ve asked the students and mentors to post their ideas here, but to lead off:
Thumbs up: our broad geographic range. I was really pleased to have schools from three oceans (four if you count the Great Lakes) take part.
Thumbs down: most projects weren&#8217;t ready to roll on day one.</p>

This week we tried to figure out what we&#8217;ll try to have done for our deadline next week. The list we obtained by the end of the meeting was as follows:
 Hooking up the dev database. Having all the external libraries situated under a single directory. Supporting more TABULAR sites. Supporting a few CALENDAR sites. Hooking up pluginFinder to the generic plugins. Supporting a query on a single url that tells you two things: if it&#8217;s parsable, and which plugin handles the parsing.</p>

      <p>MarkUs is an open-source tool which recreates the ease and flexibility of grading assignments with pen on paper, within a web application. It also allows students and instructors to form groups, and collaborate on assignments. MarkUs is implemented in Ruby on Rails, and every line of code has been written by undergraduate students. It is currently used in 3 classes at the University of Toronto. There are plans to use it for one course in Waterloo starting in January with the hopes of expanding our user base in the Fall of 2010.</p>

      <p>As the end of the semester closes in on us students, we will be piecing together or documentation from tweets, blogs, and the like. My project has allowed for many opportunities to actually edit the wiki pages on the Ingres site. While this is probably the most direct way to contribute to the community I have been working with, it ignores a subtle strength we have as new-comers to the projects we are working on: inexperience.</p>

      <p>Here are three suggestions for improving UCOSP next term [1]; comments would be very welcome.
 Have every mentoring project put together a list of 1 small task per week per student for the first four weeks of the project. The goal is to make sure that the mentors and the students are more organized and on the same page by the time the main work in the project starts. It will also serve as a weeding out period: students who can&#8217;t get four small tasks done are unlikely to be able to hack the rest of the course.</p>

 A lot of people seem to think that open source is a magic solution to project management and that open source projects will automatically attract a large and healthy community of contributors and users who will improve the software. This, of course, is not the case.
 How can people believe that open source projects are automatically a success?</p>

      <p>Basie is a web-based software project forge that integrates revision control, issue tracking, mailing lists, wikis, status dashboards, and other tools that developers need to work effectively in teams. It is simple enough for students to master in just a few minutes, but powerful enough to support large, distributed teams, and is freely distributed under an open source license.
Basie is built on top of Django, a Python-based web application framework, and the jQuery Javascript library.</p>

      <p>The Geospatial Information System industry is over $4B in size and growing rapidly. Perhaps more interesting is that geospatial (think maps) technology is being integrated into mainstream technology. For example, how may people have not used Google Maps or a GPS at some point? Technology change has made what was impossible a decade ago not only possible, but perhaps practical for firms that could not use geospatial technology in the past.</p>

      <p>The Mercurial distributed version control system is used by thousands of developers. NetBeans, OpenJDK, OpenOffice, and Python itself are just a few of the projects that have adopted Mercurial as their version control system. But as much as Mercurial has been making incredible inroads in the open-source community, it has some key deficiencies that make it a poor choice for real-life commercial development.
Here at Fog Creek Software, we&#8217;re about to release a brand-new source control management system called Kiln that&#8217;s based on Mercurial.</p>

      <p>Mozilla Thunderbird is the award winning email client created by Mozilla Messaging. Used by millions of people world wide, it is made available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux in over 40 different languages.

      <p>Pony-build is a simple system for gathering, managing, displaying, and integrating build and test results. It consists of two core components: a server (for gathering and managing results) and a client library for describing build and test processes.
The project goals are pretty open, but we&#8217;d like to enable features like &#8220;phoning home&#8221; from tests run during installation; integration with test-running frameworks; upload and storage of binary &#8220;-latest&#8221; packages; inclusion and display of code coverage; &#8220;test swarms&#8221; and a leaderboard for the Python community; integration with the Python Package Index; and configurable PubSubHubbub-based &#8220;push&#8221; notification of build events.</p>

      <p>One of the major long term goals for the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2 has been to provide an environment similar to a flight simulator for Database Administrators. Pilots used to learn to deal with potentially dangerous and stressful situations in a real plane. This was risky and expensive.

      <p>The Eclipse IDE for Education (IDE4EDU) is a version of Eclipse streamlined specifically for use by university and college students. The environment provides support for programming languages that are commonly used in university courses, including Java, Scheme, and Prolog.
Our initial efforts were focused on providing a Java environment with reduced clutter that allows students to focus on their immediate requirement of getting classroom work done. This version provided a streamlined environment featuring stripped down versions of wizards for creating common elements.</p>

      <p>I just compiled the results from the survey i did about Integrated Development Environment for the Eclipse4Edu project.
The survey was first set-up by Dennis Acosta but i did a french version of the form. These results contain only the feedback from Sherbrooke university students for now.
Surprisingly more people use the debugger and refactoring features then i would have thought. Also most people said they would not use their built-in ide tutorials.</p>

      <p>The Basie team had its meeting yesterday (chat log). The main topic of this week&#8217;s meeting was coming up with a marking rubric for the UCOSP students.
We spent some time going over one of the papers mentioned earlier &#8211; Turning Student Groups into Effective Teams (PDF) &#8211; focusing on the fourth section on peer ratings. Everyone seemed to agree with the second approach detailed on page 9 of the PDF (page 17 in the journal).</p>

      <p>There&#8217;s nothing like a bit of controversy to push up readership&#8212;and blood pressure. I inadvertently started it by describing UCOSP to Joel Spolsky at DevDays in Toronto last Friday. He thought that having undergrads work on capstone projects in distributed teams was cool&#8212;cool enough that he&#8217;s willing to sponsor the program and have one of his employees mentor a Mercurial project next term.
Browsing our blog, he came across my post &#8220;A Rational Response to an Irrational Environment&#8220;.</p>

True, but bear in mind that the whole notion of &#8220;investment&#8221; is spending resources on something that does not directly deliver present value, with the expectation of future value.</p>

      <p>By the end of this week (Oct 30), each of our teams has to propose a grading scheme they&#8217;d like used for their term&#8217;s work. To do this, they&#8217;ll have to decide (a) what they&#8217;re going to deliver by Friday December 4 (our target wrap-up date) and (b) how much of their grade will depend on the team&#8217;s accomplishments, and how much will depend on individual contributions. Experience shows that the latter is much harder to decide than the former: most people want their grade to reflect what they&#8217;ve done, but clients care about what&#8217;s delivered as a whole.</p>

      <p>My QA teacher recently pointed us to the following interesting paper. It describes a process framework for development in a distributed (optionally open-source) context. They call it Community-Agile software guidance.
Though no single process framework can apply to every projects, you&#8217;ll find that many recommendations in that paper are nowadays must-follow rules (those regarding quality in particular). I also like the way the author presents growing software as compared to a living creature that ought to be surrounded by an appropriate community in order to fully blossom and how that software needs to be guided toward maturity as it grows.</p>

Status:
&#8211; The project I was working on got canned, so I&#8217;m trying to get reacquainted with the core codebase
&#8211; Also trying to understand the intended goals and power structure of this project better so I don&#8217;t waste more work. This entails some discussion, new use of the bug tracking system for laying out goals, and group formulation of user stories (to be finished at this Friday&#8217;s meeting)</p>

Status:
&#8211; Tried to tweak to Java client to produce data file for Decision Tree. However, it was cancelled since we might not need it due to Yulia&#8217;s work to parse server log file.
&#8211; Training a goalie with the human controller to produce a convincing data file.
Next tasks:
&#8211; Testing Yulia&#8217;s log parser.
&#8211; Finding the right parameters to build Decision Tree.
Roadblocks:
&#8211; It is very difficult to get a high-quality of training data for building a good Decision Tree.</p>

      <p>Four years ago, I asked one of the best students I&#8217;ve ever had why she always did her projects in one big burst of activity starting at the last possible minute. She explained to me that (a) she was more productive if she focused on one thing at a time, rather than trying to timeslice on three or four assignments at once, and (b) the later she left it, the more stable the assignment spec would be, because the keeners that started early would have pestered the prof into correcting the inevitable omissions, ambiguities, and what-not.</p>

      <p>Over the last four or five years, there&#8217;s been a dramatic increase in the number of books about programming: not the specifics of this language or that framework, but the act of programming itself. Fogel&#8217;s Producing Open Source Software, Spinellis&#8217;s Code Reading, Ford&#8217;s The Productive Programmer, Doar&#8217;s Practical Development Environments, and multi-author collections like Beautiful Code and Beautiful Testing all discuss the things that separate people who can write code that compiles and runs from people who can build useful software.</p>

      <p>We resumed our regular meeting time today and the IRC log is at http://hypatia.cs.ualberta.ca/ucosp/index.php/UCOSP_IRC:Tue_Oct_13_2009. We have a plan for what will be done by the end of the month and we are making good progress (fingers crossed) towards it.
The interesting aspects of this week&#8217;s and last week&#8217;s discussion have been, in my view (and I welcome my team members to clarify refine and completely revise it), that
 you need a specific scenario to figure out the details where the you-know-who hides, and pictures are worth a lot of words,  Also I am happy that we have subteams, especially the two pairs.</p>

      <p>Recently I attempted to describe what kind of process we used while developing Basie. My first shot at the definition was a little off, but it turns out that there is no clear definition for how we do things. I&#8217;m looking for some feedback from fellow students on what they think of our current process and how they would go about defining it. I&#8217;m planning on coming up with another revision of this definition once I hear what others have to say.</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s been an interesting week for blog posts:
 The folks at Scout just threw away three months of development work, and improved their product by doing. The takeaway lesson is that you should continually ask yourself, &#8220;Is the thing I&#8217;m writing essential to satisfying the pressing needs of a particular user?&#8221; If the answer is no, put it aside and work on something that is. Martin Fowler (author of Refactoring and many other must-read books) has an interesting post about technical debt; David Humphrey has an equally interesting reply.</p>

      <p>The further I go in my computing education, the more entertaining I find it to look back on previous assignments and projects that I have worked on. It&#8217;s entertaining because the code that I wrote as a first year, is in my opinion terrible. It&#8217;s not only the fact that my code was terribly inefficient, it&#8217;s the fact that I have no clue what I was doing at all. I say to myself wow!</p>

      <p>On the Basie blog I recently made a post about the jQuery UI Themeroller tool and why it&#8217;s useful. One of my purposes for making the post was to draw some input about the current color theme in Basie. As developers we don&#8217;t have to make these types of decisions every day, but it&#8217;s still quite an important one. At the very least take a look and learn a bit about jQuery UI, you might find it useful some day down the road!</p>

      <p>First Patch Ever.
Once my pending patch has been checked into the source tree, I will become a member of the open source community. It doesn&#8217;t look like much but it does fix a problem. I take heart from Richard Feynman who said, &#8221; No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&#8221;. Here is a few things I learned:
 Svn needs a better way to manage patches because pending ones causes a mess.</p>

      <p>One of the reasons I&#8217;m interested in the Eclipse4Edu project is that it is heavily based on user experience. The goal is to create a streamlined IDE for beginners so that they can immediately focus on learning the language and concepts instead of struggling with an environment. Eventually, a novice can move to a classic Eclipse environment while maintaining a sense of familiarity.
One could argue that a beginner could start with the standard Eclipse environment and just ignore the &#8216;advanced&#8217; features.</p>

      <p>My team has been using Mercurial as our version control system, and it is definitely pretty cool.
We have run into some interesting &#8220;problems&#8221; though. Since the main Thunderbird repository is subversion, and we don&#8217;t have commit access, we have to submit patches that are reviewed and then committed. The real problem comes with branching, merging, and committing.
Long story made short (or the moral of the story) is that newbies shouldn&#8217;t push/pull Mercurial repos from each other.</p>

      <p>Over on the Basie blog, JP Peters has asked how you would use tagging in a web-based project management tool,while Ted Tate has asked what you&#8217;d like in such a tool&#8217;s dashboard. Meanwhile, Farah Juma has been posting ideas for grade entry in MarkUs, and would probably also like to know your thoughts. Next time you&#8217;re tired of staring at your linear algebra assignment, take a moment to give them some feedback, or post a question of your own here (or on your project&#8217;s blog, with a link from here).</p>

      <p>Morning everyone,
I just wrote a post over at the Basie blog about what type of information people would find useful on Basie&#8217;s new dashboard.
I&#8217;m hoping to try and gather as much user input on the matter as possible so your participation would be greatly appreciated.
Stay gold,

      <p>We had our first meeting after the code sprint today. The main points from the meeting are that, the three subteams should develop a wiki page describing the incremental tests they want to accomplish with an initial deadline of October 7, 2009. These tests will be evolving over time as the teams accomplish their different tasks. Another major point was to create tickets for any non trivial changes required and how a single ticket can be assigned to multiple people.</p>

      <p>Following our wonderful progress during the code-sprint, the results of which can be seen here, we&#8217;ve tried to regroup and set forth a list of goals we can achieve by the end of the semester.
For our FuseCal replacement, we hope to make it a really robust service with even more bells and whistles than FuseCal had. Here is the list of goals we came up with on Sunday, and the discussion on who wants to tackle which parts.</p>

Day 3 was more productive than I expected it to be.
 Alex and myself continued researching a third party monitor which provides extra information. Yulia and Patrik have been working on a script to allow someone to easily control a player, through the keyboard. Chani and Ioana have been working on a debugging tool.

Good:
 the code sprint was held early in term everyone got to the sprint, and got a much clearer idea of what their project is about effective initial training (for some projects) good collaboration a chance to learn how to use version control and other professional tools for real the talk about grad school was informative good workspace for the sprint, and the network ran flawlessly enjoyed pub night(s) 🙂  Bad:</p>

 Wayne Beaton (Eclipse Foundation) Steven Case (University of the Virgin Islands) Dwight Deugo (Carleton University) Karen Reid (University of Toronto) Andrew Ross (Ingres) Blake Winton (Thunderbird) Rick Yazwinski and Jody Stocks (TUCOWS) Mike Conley, Phil Patchin, Michael Reimer, and Zuzel Vera Pacheco (University of Toronto grad students)  Special thanks to Alan Rosenthal for setting up our computers and networks&#8212;everything ran perfectly all weekend long&#8212;and to our sponsors: Ingres, the Open Source Lab, Rogers, TUCOWS, and Yahoo!</p>

We had brainstorming for new features that we think might be interesting and came up with 5 new feature we all think must be done.  We also talked about the grading scheme we wanted and realised this project is kind of hard# to evaluate and that the crucial thing to focus on is the community process and communication.</p>

      <p>As I&#8217;ve written earlier, an increasing amount of research in software engineering is focused on empirical studies of what actually works (or doesn&#8217;t) in the real world. A new paper from Moe, Dingsøyr, and Dybå reports a multi-year study of teams in several companies implementing Scrum. Key problems they identified include:
 Over-specialization: if each module &#8220;belongs&#8221; to one developer, it&#8217;s hard for the group as a whole to design and plan, because no one knows enough to get a big picture view.</p>

      <p>The Robocup team had their first in-person meeting yesterday. For the first couple of hours, we played around with some of the clients developed by the students who worked on this project over the summer. Then, we had a meeting with Steve Engles, where we decided on the language an code base we want to use. We decided to go with one of the Python clients, because the Java one was using a lot of third-party code and we felt that we wouldn&#8217;t be able to improve on it from the beginning, and the other Python client was too basic.</p>

      <p>As the first day draws to a close, the elmcity crew is putting the finishing touches on our project skeleton. A very productive day has been had by all, most of us were a little unsure about how to even begin when the day started, but by now everyone has assigned themselves a part of the project. We’re essentially re-creating the backend of the defunct FuseCal, hoping to have a solid (if limited) version of it operating by the end of the code sprint weekend.</p>

      <p>The WikiDev team met this morning for the first time, and did the usual round of introductions, learning everyone&#8217;s names &#8211; and, in Botlhale&#8217;s case, pronunciations. Testing databases were setup, and the SVN repository was populated with existing code, giving us lots of stuff for playing around and testing. As a team, we decided on the architecture of the system, debating the virtues and vices of a couple of options.</p>

      <p>The Thunderbird team got off to a challenging start, with problems getting the Django framework initialized and running correctly. Eric discovered two major bugs in the setup: three directory errors in Django’s settings.py file. With the setup problems resolved, the Thunderbird team, started working on the initial problem of writing and testing unit tests. The Nose framework was chosen as the platform for the tests. Louie and Jay succeeded at creating the first fully functional test.</p>

      <p>The Eclipse4Edu team met for the first time this morning. We began to brainstorm new features then split up for pair programming sessions. Nil and I (Dennis) worked together on bug 244643.

      <p>Few topics in programming generate as much argument and as little value as wrangles over where the curly braces should go in C programs, or whether CamelCaseNames or pothole_case_names are better [1]. That said, consistency definitely matters&#8212;plenty of studies have shown that MiXiNg styles disrupts comprehension&#8212;so having a style guide and sticking to it is more important than what the style guide actually says.
I&#8217;m therefore grateful that Google has started posting its style guides for all to read.</p>

      <p>Many great computer scientists and educators have observed that while we teach students to write code, we don&#8217;t teach them to read it [1]. When you think about it, it&#8217;s ridiculous: architects study hundreds of buildings before designing one of their own, novelist probably read thousands of books before trying to create their own masterpiece [2], and only mathematicians can count how many proofs they go through in detail during their training, so why don&#8217;t programmers study great programs to improve their craft?</p>

I am Eleni Stroulia, the very excited leader of the WikiDev team this term!
I am Greek by birth and Canadian by choice. I started my research in AI, back when knowledge engineering and model-based systems were all the rage (the implied time period will be on the test:-). Since I joined the U of A, I have been working on software engineering solutions for industrially relevant problems. To these problems I usually apply AI methods to semi-automate human processes.</p>

      <p>Hi guys, I&#8217;m the team leader for Basie this term and I look forward to meeting all of you!
I started programming when I was 9 years old (true nerd roots) on an Apple II-E. The language at the time was BASIC. I graduated to QBASIC, then C, C++, HTML, JavaScript, C#, VB, SQL, etc, etc, etc. I used to think that software development is programming, and therefore languages mean everything, but I&#8217;ve discovered that languages are simply tools that have strengths and weaknesses just like anything else.</p>

      <p>Who owns open source software? The simple answer is &#8220;everyone&#8221;, but the reality is more complex. Take a look at these two documents:
 http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/committers-agreement.pdf http://www.canonical.com/contributors  In order to protect people who want to make contributions, many open source projects set up non-profit organizations. If you want to make a contribution, you have to agree to give that organization the right to use your code. That doesn&#8217;t mean you lose your rights (read the second paragraph of the Canonical agreement, for example), but it does stop you from turning around next year and saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to start a company around this, so I&#8217;d like you to take it out of your packages.</p>

      <p>An ex-student of mine is trying to decide what web technology to use in the project he&#8217;s about to start working on. The three choices are Java plus some kind of framework, Django and Python (which he knows very well), or Ruby on Rails (which he doesn&#8217;t, but could pick up quickly). The argument in favor of Java plus whatever is that his employer is sure to be able to hire good Java programmers at a reasonable price for the next decade, but as he points out, doing small or medium-sized project in Java takes longer and hurts more than doing it in a dynamic language like Python or Ruby.</p>

      <p>There are a number of tools available, both open-source and commercial which get lumped into the bucket of &#8216;functional testing tools&#8217;. Essentially they help you, well, test the functionality of your application.
One of these tools for testing web-based applications is Selenium. Selenium has at its core three different components: a record/playback tool (Se-IDE), language bindings (Se-RC) and a distributed execution framework (Se-Grid).
I put up a post on my blog called The Selenium Value Chain which briefly discusses each and the progression between them.</p>

      <p>How should a group of people find a time for a meeting? If they all work for the same organization, their availability might already be in a shared system like Outlook (though that&#8217;s by no means guaranteed). Ten years ago, Jon Udell pointed out that online tools were a good lightweight solution to this problem. The MarkUs team is already using WhenIsGood to figure out when they can get together; if your project hasn&#8217;t already picked a meeting time, maybe you&#8217;d like to give it a try too.</p>

      <p>Earlier today I used our Google Group to ask students for information for the very first time. Of the first dozen who replied, half mailed me back directly; the other half just hit &#8220;reply&#8221;, and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, Google Groups sets message headers to send replies to the whole list by default.
Oops.
So, without further ado, here&#8217;s my first apology of the term&#8212;I should have checked what the default setting was, then changed it.</p>

      <p>Mike Conley  Hi, I&#8217;m Mike Conley, and I&#8217;m one of the TA&#8217;s for this course. I will be helping Karen Reid manage the MarkUs Project this semester. I&#8217;m a Masters student at the University of Toronto in the Software Engineering group, and I just finished my undergrad at UofT, doubling in Computer Science and Dramatic Arts.
I&#8217;ve been working on MarkUs since September, 2008. I&#8217;ve been web programming in one form or another for over a decade, but MarkUs has been my first time working on a fairly sophisticated Ruby on Rails project.</p>

      <p>How do you manage development when two or more people (or teams) are making major incompatible changes at the same time? The answer is to create branches in your version control repository, but that can go sour in many ways. If you&#8217;d like some advice on how to do it right, check out:

This brings the total number of students to 46, which is nearly double our original target of two dozen. The budget for bringing them together Sept 25-27 won&#8217;t stretch much further, so we&#8217;re going to close the door on enrolment for the fall in just a few days.</p>

 Using FriendFeed to manage a loosely-coupled team.

By some estimates, 95% or more of the projects on open source portals like SourceForge and Google Code are inactive; looking at why they didn&#8217;t pan out is at least as informative as looking at the few that did.</p>

      <p>The idea of running cross-country projects was inspired by the work of many other people. Looking at what they&#8217;ve done might help students and faculty understand what we&#8217;re likely to accomplish, and why we&#8217;re doing things the way we are.
First up is Google Summer of Code, &#8220;&#8230;a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects.&#8221; 2500 students have done GSoC since its inception in 2005; each student is matched with an existing open source project and a mentor, and works full-time for 12 weeks on something specific.</p>

      <p>One of the most interesting parts of this course for me is watching students decide what projects to work on.

A great hockey player goes where the puck is going to be.&#8221; Five years ago, when Napster was making headlines, students typically wanted to write peer-to-peer filesharing tools; today, many of them want to do Ruby on Rails, social networking, or iPhone development.</p>

This is a rapidly growing area of research&#8212;many of the papers at this year&#8217;s International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE&#8217;09) presented, included, or referenced experiments or field studies of one kind or another.
Alongside this, there is growing interest in software engineering as a human activity, which has led many researchers to look at fields like social psychology.</p>

      <p>A new study shows that the more stressed you are, the more likely you are to rely on habits instead of thinking through what&#8217;s best for your actual situation. (OK, it actually shows that for rats, but it&#8217;s easy to believe that the results apply to human beings as well.) As Dave Rooney explains in a recent blog post, this is why you have to drill and drill until doing the right thing is your habit: if you don&#8217;t, then when the going gets rough, you&#8217;ll revert to your earlier (and probably less productive) training, which will then increase your stress, and down you go.</p>

      <p>One of the questions programmers often ask (and are often asked) is, &#8220;Are we done yet?&#8221; It&#8217;s often hard to know: unlike spaghetti, you can&#8217;t just throw software against the wall to see if it sticks. &#8220;When we run out of time&#8221; and &#8220;when we run out of money&#8221; are common answers in the real world, but there are better ways, and this page shows one of them.

For this term, I think students will be working on a Django (Python) site to manage the ISP configuration information for Thunderbird. There may also be some Javascript work to hook in to whatever pieces need to be added to the database.
To quote David Ascher (who&#8217;s in charge of Mozilla Messaging):
 From a student project POV, especially given the schedule (fall, when we&#8217;ll be locking things down in TB3), I suspect getting them working on the Django site that powers the database that manages the autoconfig data would be an interesting idea.</p>

      <p>Hot on the heels of yesterday&#8217;s news about students from Toronto, Waterloo, and Simon Fraser comes word that three students from Michigan State University will be joining us as well. That brings the total to 21, and it&#8217;s still just the first week of August.</p>

      <p>We&#8217;re very pleased to welcome our first students: seven from the University of Toronto, six from Waterloo, and five from Simon Fraser. We&#8217;re looking forward to adding more in the weeks to come, and to matching them all with projects.</p>
