  <p>Peter from UofT checks in:</p>

<p>ReviewBoard is a web service which facilitates code review amongst developers</p>

<p>within a repository (Git, SVN, etc). The project I am working on is an</p>

<p>implementation of TogetherJS, an extension (or plugin) that organizations can</p>

<p>choose to install within their instance of ReviewBoard. TogetherJS is a</p>

<p>javascript library that allows multiple users to discuss a webpage through</p>

<p>text and voice chat and live cursor interaction. A demo is available here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfbREmTBjc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEfbREmTBjc</a> It is similar to screen sharing</p>

<p>on Skype but has limited capabilities. Some of the features I have been</p>

<p>assigned to implement are to decouple this service from the Mozilla servers</p>

<p>and to reduce dependency on WebRTC. There will be an interesting balancing act</p>

<p>between taking advantage of all the available tools from the library and</p>

<p>keeping the extension a standalone project that services the needs of</p>

<p>ReviewBoard. The objective of this project is to help multiple developers</p>

<p>discuss a single commit in real time while in remote locations.</p>

<p>The most important lesson I have learnt in UCOSP is that this is not a course.</p>

<p>There are supervisors from the faculty, mentors of the project and peers.</p>

<p>However, there are no lectures, no assignments, no deadlines, no tests.</p>

<p>Throughout undergrad, attending lectures, keeping tabs on assignment and test</p>

<p>deadlines, and starting early to meet these demands helped me succeed. However</p>

<p>this does not work well with UCOSP. UCOSP requires a different type of</p>

<p>dedication. You really need to set aside time to work on it on a regular</p>

<p>basis. Furthermore you need to ask questions frequently. Itâ€™s very unintuitive</p>

<p>because with regular courses, the more time you spend on a problem on your</p>

<p>own, the more you learn. The opposite is true here. The more time you waste</p>

<p>trying to solve something on your own, the worse your overall performance. It</p>

<p>is much more productive to consult your mentors at every roadblock. Some</p>

<p>people may find asking many little questions bothersome but the mentors love</p>

<p>it. If they did not like helping, they would not have become mentors. The</p>

<p>UCOSP learning experience is really different, but there is no reason you can</p>

<p>not succeed because there is so much help available if you take advantage of</p>

<p>it.</p>
