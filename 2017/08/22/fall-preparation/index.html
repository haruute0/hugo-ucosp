  <p>The fall projects are now available.  We are happy to welcome back six projects from recent years.  These include two projects that have been with us since the beginning or nearly the beginning of UCOSP: Reviewboard and Umple.  We are welcoming back Julian and the Formulize project as well as three projects from Mozilla: Firefox development tools, Code Coverage, and Task Cluster.</p>

<p>Our new projects include another Firefox Development Tools project on the React debugger, and two new projects with a more analytic focus.  The WALA and Swift project is a collaboration between IBM and the University of Alberta.  The Safe Browsing and Tracker Prevention will involve some data collection and analysis.</p>

<p>I think I would have a hard time making my choices if I were a student with these options.  Thanks again to the mentors for volunteering their time to work with UCOSP students.  I&rsquo;m sure we will have a great term.</p>
