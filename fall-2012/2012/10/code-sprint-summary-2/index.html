  <p>UCOSP 2012 is off and running following a successful code sprint in Kitchener Waterloo last weekend.  We have 58 students from 16 different Canadian universities working on 8 projects this term and from everything I saw and heard, the sprint was a great success.</p>

<p>The UCOSP program operates under the <a href="http://cacsaic.org">Canadian Association of Computer Science</a> (CACS/AIC).  Michelle Craig, chair of the UCOSP steering committee, attended the CACS/AIC Chairs meeting in the spring and once again promoted the program, so we are able to welcome even more universities to the program.</p>

<p><a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rtholmes/">Reid Holmes</a>, a member of the steering committee, made all the local arrangements in Kitchener Waterloo, and in particular, connected with <a href="https://www.communitech.ca">Communitech</a> who allowed us to use the Hub for the sprint. They were excellent hosts, and it was a real pleasure to work in such a great space.  The Communitech Hub is in the same building as the <a href="http://www.google.com/about/jobs/locations/waterloo/">Google</a> office, and we were treated to a tour of the office, lightning talks about open source projects at Google, and a fabulous lunch.  Google is our primary sponsor for the fall sprint, so were especially grateful that they were willing to give us a tour and feed us as well.</p>

<p>As always, it was great to see the buzz in the rooms as the students got to know each other and their mentors, and began to really wrap their heads around their projects. We are very fortunate to have great mentors participate in the program, and this year we had a record 4 mentors who were once UCOSP students themselves.  Thanks for coming back!!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~reid/">I&#8217;m</a> both a member of the steering committee and the project mentor for MarkUs. This term the MarkUs project members come from seven universities in five time time zones: UBC, University of Alberta, University of Manitoba, University of Waterloo, University of Toronto, L&#8217;Université Sherbrooke, and Dalhousie University.  Needless to say, it is a challenge to find a common meeting time! Nevertheless, the enthusiasm of the team members and their willingness to just dive in is great to see!</p>

<p>I hope everyone has a great term!</p>
