      <description>Our FlightSim project has come to a close last week, after posting our final delieverable. It&amp;#8217;s been a long ride, so I thought I should take my time to write down my experience and what I&amp;#8217;ve learned here.
Different from most of you, our project started at IBM&amp;#8217;s lab, not at the St. George campus. On our first morning, all of us were invited to their lab at Markham. The lab itself is a really cool place, and the IBMers have treated us well.</description>

General Comments for tutorials:
 The page of ugly columns can be shown in a better way in TE, Matthew will provide further information The ad-hoc is now split into 2 panels, this can be displayed in 2 panels instead of split panels The column rendering can be used to show the values on the dial, so dials can display a wider range  General Update</description>

      <description>It had been a busy an productive month and a half. I&amp;#8217;ll start off by pointing to the first two prototypes delivered by group on Thursday February 25 2010:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrz1ph_4Nms

Quickly, you are looking at is a simulation of a specific problems what can occur within a database system. The problem is then identified using the SQL monitoring functionality available within DB2 and then that mass of information refined into some simple prototype indicators.</description>

      <description>This is my midterm update of the Flight Simulator project
As the team lead on the student side for the first time in my life, I can feel the responsibility and challenge from my role all the time. I am basically using agile methodology I experienced in my previous coop work team and it turned out that everything worked out quite well. Tickets are opened and closed on time, and deliverables are officially accepted by IBM on the delivering date, so we can tell that the team is well on-track.</description>

      <description>The progress of the term is going well since the deliverables are completed on time and the IBM folks are satisfied with them. The most important feeling in this project is that, although we are physically in three different cities, two different time zones, we are able to keep up the communication and plans. Each of us are assigned with a task, complete it on time, and merge all of our work into one deliverable, and this cycle goes on, even though all of us are busy with other things at the same time.</description>

      <description>The term started off with an earlier Code Sprint kickoff than last term and this definitely helped get things in motion much quicker and allowed us to address problems much earlier on which I found was most helpful this term as our team ran into a series of dependent environment setup issues that delayed a lot of the work. The goals and requirements of the project were fairly vague at first, but despite these early setbacks, I found that the team I am working with this term (compared to my last term with UCOSP) is a lot more self-driven and willing to communicate, ask questions, keep each other updated and help each other out.</description>

      <description>We spent the first week or two setting things up and play around with DB2. Getting everything we need up and running was a bit tricky, because some major pieces of our toolkit is still in its infancy. Therefore, I spent quite a lot of time documenting my experience on the developer&amp;#8217;s wiki because I believe this would help students that are joining this project in future semesters (as well as our teamates).</description>

      <description>So this week I&amp;#8217;m looking into resursive SQL queries. And my goa? To saturate the CPU with that 😀 So normally you&amp;#8217;d want to make your query fast and avoid O(n^2) queries as much as possible, but now I&amp;#8217;m doing the opposite and make it use as much CPU as possible. Kinda awesome you get to do that for a school project isn&amp;#8217;t it!</description>

      <description>In the flight sim team we relied on skype for all non-verbal communication. It so happened that there is a global skype outage last Thursday right which happed to collide with our weekly team meeting&amp;#8217;s time. (Good thing that we are using IBM&amp;#8217;s conferce call infrastructure for our meeting.) Twitter again proved to be the best way to look for outage information like these &amp;#8211; a quick search for the #Skype hash tag quickly revealed to me that a lot of people are having the same problem, and eventually leads me to the official @Skype Twitter account.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Greg, all the mentors/organisers and the nice people from IBM (especially Matthew) for everything they have done for us. They have obviously put lots of effort and their spare time into this and I think we should all give them a big round of aplause.
So.. the code sprint is now officially over.. and here is what I think..
What I liked:
 Having the chance to meet everyone before we actually start coding turns out to be extremely valuable.</description>

      <description>What we did today:
 Assigned work to each team member, following the agile development style, we now have 10 small, measurable tickets here &amp;#8211; the goal of this sprint is to deliver 4 scenarios, and piloting graphical indicator for the next sprint. So we will have enough knowledge of the code in the team when the next sprint begins.  We have our first road blocker today &amp;#8211; the WMDServer does not work on either of our environments, whether it being Mac, Windows 7 or Windows Vista, and we have decided to work on the following items:</description>
