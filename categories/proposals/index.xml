      <description>MarkUs is an open-source tool which recreates the ease and flexibility of grading assignments with pen on paper, within a web application. It also allows students and instructors to form groups, and collaborate on assignments. MarkUs is implemented in Ruby on Rails, and every line of code has been written by undergraduate students. It is currently used in 3 classes at the University of Toronto. There are plans to use it for one course in Waterloo starting in January with the hopes of expanding our user base in the Fall of 2010.</description>

      <description>The objective of the team project is to develop a 3d visualization in Sun&amp;#8217;s Wonderland. The team will be given access to a WikiDev2.0 project with a set of data on multiple versions of a project developed collaboratively by a small team. The WikiDev repository includes data about classes their metrics and the relations among them. The task will be to implement 3D models and appropriate interactions for users to explore the data in WL, using a city metaphor, as discussed in the paper &amp;#8220;A 3D Metaphor for Software Production Visualization&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; see http://ieeexplore.</description>

      <description>Basie is a web-based software project forge that integrates revision control, issue tracking, mailing lists, wikis, status dashboards, and other tools that developers need to work effectively in teams. It is simple enough for students to master in just a few minutes, but powerful enough to support large, distributed teams, and is freely distributed under an open source license.
Basie is built on top of Django, a Python-based web application framework, and the jQuery Javascript library.</description>

      <description>The Geospatial Information System industry is over $4B in size and growing rapidly. Perhaps more interesting is that geospatial (think maps) technology is being integrated into mainstream technology. For example, how may people have not used Google Maps or a GPS at some point? Technology change has made what was impossible a decade ago not only possible, but perhaps practical for firms that could not use geospatial technology in the past.</description>

      <description>The Mercurial distributed version control system is used by thousands of developers. NetBeans, OpenJDK, OpenOffice, and Python itself are just a few of the projects that have adopted Mercurial as their version control system. But as much as Mercurial has been making incredible inroads in the open-source community, it has some key deficiencies that make it a poor choice for real-life commercial development.
Here at Fog Creek Software, we&amp;#8217;re about to release a brand-new source control management system called Kiln that&amp;#8217;s based on Mercurial.</description>

      <description>Pony-build is a simple system for gathering, managing, displaying, and integrating build and test results.Â It consists of two core components: a server (for gathering and managing results) and a client library for describing build and test processes.
The project goals are pretty open, but we&amp;#8217;d like to enable features like &amp;#8220;phoning home&amp;#8221; from tests run during installation; integration with test-running frameworks; upload and storage of binary &amp;#8220;-latest&amp;#8221; packages; inclusion and display of code coverage; &amp;#8220;test swarms&amp;#8221; and a leaderboard for the Python community; integration with the Python Package Index; and configurable PubSubHubbub-based &amp;#8220;push&amp;#8221; notification of build events.</description>

      <description>One of the major long term goals for the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2 has been to provide an environment similar to a flight simulator for Database Administrators. Pilots used to learn to deal with potentially dangerous and stressful situations in a real plane. This was risky and expensive. Pilots today learn to deal with system failures and extreme conditions on flight simulators. DBAs still develop their experience on live multi-million dollar production systems.</description>

      <description>The Eclipse IDE for Education (IDE4EDU) is a version of Eclipse streamlined specifically for use by university and college students. The environment provides support for programming languages that are commonly used in university courses, including Java, Scheme, and Prolog.
Our initial efforts were focused on providing a Java environment with reduced clutter that allows students to focus on their immediate requirement of getting classroom work done. This version provided a streamlined environment featuring stripped down versions of wizards for creating common elements.</description>
