      <description>Victoria Status  Brainstormed ideas for the Dashboard. Went through draft Dashboard contents with Karen and Farah and got some good and constructive feedback  Next Steps  With the feedback I got back regarding the potential Dashboard contents, come up with a preliminary prototype &amp;#8212; one that we can take apart and help establish a better idea as to how we&amp;#8217;d like to design the Dashboard.  Roadblocks  Swamped with work (from my full-time position).</description>

      <description>The time is running so fast that it is already the middle of the term. It has been a quite exciting time for me since I joined UCOSP, joined my team – MarkUs. After 2 months work with our team, I feel more confident in working for MarkUs.
What I have learned
For the technique aspect, I am more familiar with Rails development. I have learned setting up the workspace for Rails, basic Ruby syntax and basic way of Rails development.</description>

      <description>Summary:
Things are going slower than expected. I thought I would be able to get so much more done. The first few weeks were spent on my first changelist. My expectation was to be done with the first week [8]. I have learned tons about Ruby, Rails, Rails plugins and javascript. I am currently working on replaced the AJAX pagination with serverside pagination on the submissions page. Afterwards, I will be working on the detailed view for the submissions page.</description>

      <description>Expectations, Status &amp;amp; Progress
Coming into this UCOSP project course, my ultimate goal was to be able to utilize the human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) design knowledge that I’ve acquired from both school and work to enhance the usability of MarkUs. Through this experience, I’m hoping to solidify my understanding of various usability concepts and familiarize myself with more projects out there.
Up until now, I feel that I’m on track with the work that I’m doing with MarkUs.</description>

      <description>Two months have passed since I joined Markus in Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Project (UCOSP). I thought it was just another course, but it&amp;#8217;s a completely different than every other one I&amp;#8217;ve ever taken.
The most noticeable difference is that no instructor is around! In a regular course, I am told how to do stuffs. I sit in a comfortable chair in the classroom, follow the instructions given by teachers and do best I to meet their expectation.</description>

      <description>The first half of the semester has flown by quickly. Like last semester, I&amp;#8217;m really enjoying being a part of the MarkUs team! It was nice to already have my development environment from last semester all set and ready to go for this semester. Since I didn&amp;#8217;t have to spend any time on setup, I was able to jump back into the code right away. I&amp;#8217;ve found that things make a lot more sense to me now than they did around the same time last semester.</description>

      <description>Simply put, I&amp;#8217;m dissatisfied with my performance with MarkUs.  Up until now, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing what could be considered the bare minimum of work to get a passing &amp;#8220;grade&amp;#8221; for UCOSP. This is my final school term which means I&amp;#8217;m looking to the future a lot this term, searching for full time employment. While I&amp;#8217;ve been very successful in this endeavour to tell the truth, it does mean that certain trade offs have been made which have not been to MarkUs&amp;#8217; benefit.</description>

If you make it to the bottom, you can see that I haven&amp;#8217;t done very much. Interviews take up so much time! It&amp;#8217;s a good problem to have, but I can&amp;#8217;t help be feel a bit of guilt for pushing MarkUs off to the side for them.
Because of the flexible nature of UCOSP, it&amp;#8217;s possible for me to do this. I&amp;#8217;m just using my banked up hours from the code-sprint sooner rather than later.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone,
 Joseph Mate  My name is Joseph. I am in 3B Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and will be working with MarkUs this term. I have not worked an open source project before; however, I am eager to start. I have lots of experience with Java from school and work. I have a little experience with C#, Python and Unix Shell Programming. I recently started playing around with Ruby and this term will be an excellent opportunity to extend what I already know.</description>

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;#8217;m in my final term of a Bachelor of Computer Science. I&amp;#8217;ve learned from co-ops at Maplesoft, RIM, Amazon.com and Next Level Games, where I&amp;#8217;ve been a scriptor, a build monkey, a manual tester, a Java jockey, and a C++ centurion. I have no favourite language, because I can pick them up easily enough. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things.
I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the MarkUs Project this term from winter-laden Waterloo.</description>

      <description>Hi all!
I am Brian Xu from SFU and currently experiencing my last year of undergraduate.
It feels really exciting when I received the admission mail to UCOSP. My latest projects experience are all related to web development such as leading a team to develop a website using Flex/PHP/MySQL, and working in HSBC for 8 months on website configuration and development. I am sure MarkUs is another great opportunity to broaden my knowledge about web development and also to learn from you genius!</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, I&amp;#8217;m Bryan Shen, a 5th year CS student from SFU. I&amp;#8217;m very glad to have the chance to work with you guys on Markus.
I&amp;#8217;ve been enjoying programming ever since the first time I said &amp;#8220;hello world&amp;#8221; in C. Now my major languages are C-style ones such as Java and C#, and I&amp;#8217;m now working with ASP.net web development. I&amp;#8217;m eager to learn new technologies, and I believe it&amp;#8217;ll be a joy to shift to Ruby on Rails from my past experience.</description>

      <description>MarkUs is an open-source tool which recreates the ease and flexibility of grading assignments with pen on paper, within a web application. It also allows students and instructors to form groups, and collaborate on assignments. MarkUs is implemented in Ruby on Rails, and every line of code has been written by undergraduate students. It is currently used in 3 classes at the University of Toronto. There are plans to use it for one course in Waterloo starting in January with the hopes of expanding our user base in the Fall of 2010.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a list of tools I cast essential for carrying out my day-to-day business or I find otherwise useful.
Hardware (in no particular order)**
**
 My primary workstation is a HP Pavillion Slimline, a pretty much standard, off-the-shelf PC on which I installed Ubuntu Linux. The hardware works reasonable well under Linux, but at some point I wish hardware vendors would just offer some models which work seamlessly with any major OS.</description>

      <description>Here are the latest progress reports from the teams (with Ingres, Thunderbird, and WikiDev still to come):
 Basie * Build a toy application in Django and check it into the Subversion repository to prove that they have started learning the framework.  Get Basie running on their development machine and send us a URL so that we can check it. Fix some of our broken test fixtures (long story) and put their changes up for code review.</description>

      <description>The MarkUs team has spent the week getting their development environments set up. Thanks to a little elbow grease, we seem to be up and running on Linux, OSX, and Windows!
One new team member has even gone so far as to get a patch reviewed, submit it to the repo, and close a ticket. And it was also MarkUs&amp;#8217;s 1000th revision! What an awesome start! Great job, team!

      <description>Hi, I am Simon Lavigne-Giroux. I&amp;#8217;m at my fourth year in software engineering at Université Laval. I&amp;#8217;m studying in this domain because I wanted to use my favourite tools, computers, completely. I also really like the logic and problem resolution in software programming. In the past year, I&amp;#8217;ve developed web applications in Java using Spring MVC and other frameworks. I&amp;#8217;m excited to learn Ruby on Rails on the MarkUs project. It is also my first experience on an open source project.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Farah Juma and I&amp;#8217;m going to be working on MarkUs this fall.
I&amp;#8217;m a fourth year computer science student at the University of Toronto. I&amp;#8217;m doing a specialist in artificial intelligence. I just completed a 16-month internship at Red Hat, as part of the Professional Experience Year program at U of T. I was on the JBoss Application Server team. It was an amazing experience and I learned a lot!</description>

      <description>Hi!
I am Severin Gehwolf, a second/third year Computer Science student at University of Toronto. Before coming to Toronto &amp;#8211; starting my second degree &amp;#8211; I was working for almost 2 years. It was then when I realized what interests me most: Software and its very internals.
I got involved with MarkUs and Ruby on Rails during winter term 2009, but really didn&amp;#8217;t do any Rails development until this summer when I started to work on MarkUs full-time.</description>

      <description>Hi All!
My name is Melanie Gaudet and I am going to work on MarkUs project this fall. I have started my journey with computers by a 3 years study in computer science(CEGEP). I have been hired in a great company, first as Progress database’s administrator, and then as programmer-analyst and finally as project leader. The programming language I have been using the most so far is Progress, but I have tried many others so even though I have never worked with Rubby, I know that I will learn.</description>

      <description>Mike Conley  Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Mike Conley, and I&amp;#8217;m one of the TA&amp;#8217;s for this course. I will be helping Karen Reid manage the MarkUs Project this semester. I&amp;#8217;m a Masters student at the University of Toronto in the Software Engineering group, and I just finished my undergrad at UofT, doubling in Computer Science and Dramatic Arts.
I&amp;#8217;ve been working on MarkUs since September, 2008. I&amp;#8217;ve been web programming in one form or another for over a decade, but MarkUs has been my first time working on a fairly sophisticated Ruby on Rails project.</description>

      <description>Adam Goucher taught me most of what I know about quality assurance. He&amp;#8217;s now in charge of the same at Zerofootprint, as well as a regular speaker at agile and testing conferences, and has kindly agreed to give the MarkUs team some guidance this fall. (Basie and Thunderbird teams take note: much of what he says applies to you too.) His thirty-second guide is a good place to start; I look forward to hearing more from him.</description>

      <description>Over on the MarkUs blog, Karen Reid has posted an introduction to the team for the fall, and promised to outline projects the students might take on. Meanwhile, Bill Konrad has posted some project ideas for Basie, and I&amp;#8217;ll follow up with an introduction to the team later this week. We should have all our students in place by the end of this week; things will start moving pretty quickly once Labor Day has come and gone.</description>
