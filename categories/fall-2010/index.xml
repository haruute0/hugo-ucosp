      <description>A guest post by the CoRAL team.
Since this project was conceptualized and named in early October, we have made great strides in designing a user and application programming interface for visualizing activity on CoRAL (Collaborative Review Analysis of Literature) and to be used in tandem with the Fab4Browser. CoRAL/Fab4 is an academic publication browser that allows users to comment, discuss and annotate academic papers. It was designed to facilitate discussion and development of ideas and encourage collaboration and sharing of viewpoints between different experts of the scientific community.</description>

      <description>Originally posted by Mike Conley on the Review Board student blog.
If you’ve been following this blog, you’ll know that the team has been working very hard on their projects. But I’ll bet those status reports can be a bit cryptic sometimes.
So here’s my take on where we are so far, in no particular order:
 Hongbin has been working on an extension that will allow communication between Review Board and various bug-trackers.</description>

      <description>A guest post by team member Todd Ritchie.
The Basie/Pinax team has been working on a mailing list module for the next iteration of Basie. This module was designed with the intent of being able to decouple it from Basie and use it with any Pinax application. We started from scratch and during the code sprint we managed to get creation of mailing lists working, addition of subscribed e-mail lists, and walking of subscribed e-mails so that we can send messages.</description>

      <description>POSIT aims to create a portable, opensource tool for the Android platform to aid search and rescue efforts by allowing the transmission of data between users and to central servers. Mentor Ralph Morelli provided this update:
Things are going very well with the POSIT group. The students have now all identified appropriate projects and each is making steady progress on their work. We have been meeting every Thursday for a brief Skype conference during which we discuss any issues that come up.</description>

      <description>The CoRAL team (formerly known as fab4) has been making great progress on our task.
The task is to develop a visualization service for the fab4 browser project, whose objective is to support communities of readers by allowing them to share their comments on the documents they read. The original fab4 project simply provides a canvas on which to place and view annotations of different types on a document.
In our work, we assume that the fab4 user community consists of researchers either reviewing papers for the purpose of writing surveys and related-research sections of new publications or for the purpose of accepting/rejecting papers submitted to a conference.</description>

      <title>Fall semester code sprint — it&amp;#8217;s a wrap!</title>

      <description>This weekend, over 50 students and project mentors gathered in Toronto for this semester&amp;#8217;s code sprint.

Why go through all the trouble and expense of bringing students together to a single physical location to work on their projects? Isn&amp;#8217;t the point of UCOSP to teach students to work in a distributed environment? Yes, but from experience, we&amp;#8217;ve found that when teams are able to meet even once, the odds of success are dramatically increased.</description>
