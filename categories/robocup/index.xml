      <description>Positive: Finally, I can experience working on a real, fully distributed team. Also, I learn a lot of technical stuff from this course. From programming in python to machine learning algorithms. I am also grateful to learn from my colleagues as this is more practical than learning from textbooks.
Negative: I couldn&amp;#8217;t contribute to the team as much as I want to. There are various reasons for this but most notably is due to the complexity and difficulty of the project.</description>

      <description>For the most part we are all trying to wrap things up. Here&amp;#8217;s how we plan to divide the final work load.
Yulia + Ioana: Look into fixing coordinate system.
Chani: Will put together a skeleton of the document.
Patrik: Will write up an overview of the source code by Tuesday.
Alex: Plans to finish his passing improvements and contribute a write up of why we choose the python code.</description>

      <description>I worked on RoboCup and I have to say it didn&amp;#8217;t turn out to be what I expected in the beginning. But I really enjoyed it despite the problems we had (just like any other team this term).
There isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot of bad things I can say about the csc494 experience. We pretty much lost that month before the Code Sprint because we couldn&amp;#8217;t get an access to the repository.</description>

      <description>We had our meeting on Sunday, November 22. Here is what the team had been up to:
Alex
&amp;#8211; worked on passing, now it takes into account players from the opposit team
&amp;#8211; it is hard to make 100% accurate passing because of the noise added to the measurements
Next task:
&amp;#8211; work on interception as it is related to passing
Chani
&amp;#8211; fixed code so that now players are using data from the current tick</description>

      <description>Being a part of the Robocup UCOSP project has been an interesting experience.
First, I&amp;#8217;ll discusses some of the issues with this project. It&amp;#8217;s not actually an open source project, and it&amp;#8217;s not really under development by anyone other then my group members. This is an issue because we didn&amp;#8217;t really get to experience that side of an open source project (ie. being part of a larger picture and lending a hand).</description>

      <description>the good: Working with a good team. We&amp;#8217;ve all had those projects where half the team is asleep or incapable of communicating or just doesn&amp;#8217;t do their work. This was one of those rare group projects where I got to be in a group of students who *wanted* to be there. it&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;m more used to in the free software world but not in school.
the bad: The chaos. Having our team drop to 5 people threw off a lot of the plans we&amp;#8217;d made at the sprint.</description>

      <description>ThumbUp: Having meetings every week and posting status reports helped keep us on track.
ThumbDown: I think it would be good to have more variety in projects, in particular some that are less development-oriented and involve more research</description>

      <description>alex:
-has been trying to improve passing by having the kicker shout out where the ball is going, but the other players don&amp;#8217;t always hear it
-will try other ways to improve passing
chani:
-implemented ball and player decay
-found out that the code for updating object positions was never being called and fixed that
-is working on vision optimization
-improved the debug viewer a bit more
-may also experiment with changing minimum-confidence values</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a list of tools I cast essential for carrying out my day-to-day business or I find otherwise useful.
Hardware (in no particular order)**
**
 My primary workstation is a HP Pavillion Slimline, a pretty much standard, off-the-shelf PC on which I installed Ubuntu Linux. The hardware works reasonable well under Linux, but at some point I wish hardware vendors would just offer some models which work seamlessly with any major OS.</description>

      <description>Alex
Status:
&amp;#8211; Tried to tweak to Java client to produce data file for Decision Tree. However, it was cancelled since we might not need it due to Yulia&amp;#8217;s work to parse server log file.
&amp;#8211; Training a goalie with the human controller to produce a convincing data file.
Next tasks:
&amp;#8211; Testing Yulia&amp;#8217;s log parser.
&amp;#8211; Finding the right parameters to build Decision Tree.
Roadblocks:
&amp;#8211; It is very difficult to get a high-quality of training data for building a good Decision Tree.</description>

 Make multi-tick actions possible instead of always choosing an action from scratch every tick (which should make Ioana&amp;#8217;s next task easier too).  Roadblocks:</description>

      <description>The Robocup team had their first in-person meeting yesterday. For the first couple of hours, we played around with some of the clients developed by the students who worked on this project over the summer. Then, we had a meeting with Steve Engles, where we decided on the language an code base we want to use. We decided to go with one of the Python clients, because the Java one was using a lot of third-party code and we felt that we wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to improve on it from the beginning, and the other Python client was too basic.</description>

      <description>Here are the latest progress reports from the teams (with Ingres, Thunderbird, and WikiDev still to come):
 Basie * Build a toy application in Django and check it into the Subversion repository to prove that they have started learning the framework.  Get Basie running on their development machine and send us a URL so that we can check it. Fix some of our broken test fixtures (long story) and put their changes up for code review.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Ioana Ivan and I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the RoboCup project. I&amp;#8217;m in my forth year at UofT, doing a specialist in bioinformatics and computational biology, but I&amp;#8217;m thinking about staying for an extra year and switching into AI. I&amp;#8217;d like to go to graduate school after I graduate.
Last year, I did an internship at Red Hat, working on the IcedTea/Openjdk team. I&amp;#8217;ve previously worked on a second year research project in bioinformatics at UofT, and a research project on medical imaging at Oxford.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Brent Mombourquette. I&amp;#8217;m in my third year studying computer science at University of Toronto. I&amp;#8217;m aiming for a specialist in Artificial Intelligence, although so far I haven&amp;#8217;t taken any AI related courses.
During this fall I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the RoboCup Soccer project. I spent this past summer working with Professor Steve Easterbrook, developing a Firefox plug-in to aid climate scientists in researching. It was a great experience, although I was working by myself.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Chani Armitage. I&amp;#8217;m studying comp sci at Simon Fraser University, and previously studied at BCIT. I work on the KDE project in my free time. I&amp;#8217;ve done three Google Summer of Code projects with them now (it&amp;#8217;s awesome, you should apply next spring).
This fall I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the Robocup project. My first programming experience was for an Artificial Life game (Creatures 3), so I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to doing some AI programming.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone. I&amp;#8217;m Patrik Gornicz who will be working on the RoboCup project.
I am a third year student at the University of Waterloo in their Computer Science program. I have enjoyed their coop program by tutoring CS for two terms. My other two coop terms have been spent programming the MediaGo application for Sony Creative Software.
As a hobby I&amp;#8217;ve been developing a personal C++ library that is currently being used by a simple 2D physics simulator.</description>
