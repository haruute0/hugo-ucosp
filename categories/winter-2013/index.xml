      <description>Here is the first blog post from Umple, written by Geoffrey Guest.
Flying has never been a joy of mine, however, we made it here in one piece
so I guess I can&amp;#8217;t really complain. I met up with another UCOSPer, purely
by coincedence, on the way down. It turns out we both fit the bill of
&amp;#8220;computer science student&amp;#8221; in our own imaginations. The weekend was already
shaping up to be an excellent social and academic experience.</description>

      <description>This term&amp;#8217;s code sprint was held at Facebook Headquarters in California. Holding the sprint outside of Canada was a first for UCOSP, but it enabled us to join up with 110 students from several US and International schools that were also holding a similar weekend hackfest on the Facebook campus. This term 43 students from 19 Canadian universities are working on 7 different projects. Photos to follow.</description>
