      <description>OSCON? What&amp;#8217;s OSCON?
 A keynote talk at OSCON   OSCON brings together people like you from across the open source universe to learn, inspire each other, and collaborate.
 If our mission is to get students working on cool open source projects, what better place to look for mentors?
In addition, we were interested in how other people are teaching open source software in academia. Luckily, OSCON had lots of people with something to say on the topic.</description>

      <description>UCOSP, the distributed undergraduate capstone course, is preparing for another year and we need your help!
Forgot what UCOSP is? Here&amp;#8217;s a refresher.
 Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects brings together students from coast to coast to work together on joint capstone projects. Students learn first-hand what distributed development is like. Each team has students from two or three schools, and uses a mix of agile and open source processes under the supervision of a faculty or industry lead.</description>
