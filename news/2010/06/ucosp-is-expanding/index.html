  <p>UCOSP, the distributed undergraduate capstone course, is preparing for another year and we need your help!</p>

<p>Forgot what UCOSP is? Here&#8217;s a refresher.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects</strong> <strong>brings together students from coast to coast to work together on joint capstone projects.</strong> Students learn first-hand what distributed development is like. Each team has students from two or three schools, and uses a mix of agile and open source processes under the supervision of a faculty or industry lead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Need to know more? We have answers to your questions on our <a href="http://ucosp.ca/about/">About page</a>.</p>

<p>In preparation for this September, we&#8217;re looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Students</strong>: Work on an open-source project with other students from across the countryâ€”for credit! What could be better?</li>
<li><strong>Faculty mentors</strong>: We&#8217;re looking to expand the number of schools participating this year.</li>
<li><strong>Open source mentors</strong>: Are you involved in an open source project? Help a team of students make a contribution to your software.</li>
<li><strong>Industry sponsors</strong>: We need your help to bring students together for a code sprint at the beginning of the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this has caught your interest, please get in touch via email: <a href="mailto:admin@ucosp.ca">admin@ucosp.ca</a>. Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
