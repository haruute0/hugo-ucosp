  <p>The Geospatial Information System industry is over $4B in size and growing rapidly. Perhaps more interesting is that geospatial (think maps) technology is being integrated into mainstream technology. For example, how may people have not used Google Maps or a GPS at some point? Technology change has made what was impossible a decade ago not only possible, but perhaps practical for firms that could not use geospatial technology in the past. Driving this along with technology change are new standards and a non-profit foundation called the <a href="http://osgeo.org" target="_blank">Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)</a>.</p>

<p>GeoTools is a geospatial toolkit developed in Java that is used by <a href="http://geoserver.org">GeoServer</a>, a standards-based web mapping engine under the banner of <a href="http://www.osgeo.org" target="_blank">OSGeo</a>. It is feature rich and very competitive in terms of performance with other web mapping software available today. [](<a href="http://geoserver.org)There">http://geoserver.org)There</a> is government, industry, and community interest in this project. This project therefore has the potential to enable a consortium of smaller firms to rally together and bid on geospatial projects tendered by larger firms and governments. This in turn has a high likelihood of creating jobs, saving the government and industry firms money, strengthen the open source geospatial community, and enable the scientific teams to be more productive.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity for students to learn a lot about Java, Java web programming, geospatial technologies, and databases, and to work with teams from <a href="http://www.ingres.com">Ingres</a>, <a href="http://opengeo.org/">OpenGeo</a>, <a href="http://www.osgeo.org">OSGeo</a>, and roughly half a dozen other companies. This project could launch a very successful career for students with the organizations involved. Many of these firms are recruiting in anticipation of baby boomer retirements coming in the next decade.</p>
