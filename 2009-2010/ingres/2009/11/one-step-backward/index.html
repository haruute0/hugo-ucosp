  <p>Sometimes it is hard to recognize when a problem can be best solved by starting over. Over the past few days I have been making a lot of configurations on Windows using something called &#8216;Windows Configuration-By-Forms&#8217;. You can start it by going to the command prompt(typing &#8220;cmd&#8221; in Start-&gt;Run) and typing the command &#8220;cbf&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, after all was said and done I wasn&#8217;t able to load php pages consistently. I previously was able to connect to an Ingres database, but not return any successful queries. Looks like I set something incorrectly.</p>

<p>However, since my role in this is to perform testing and documentation this will offer me the chance to document each step as I start over with my PHP install.</p>

<p>ASIDE:</p>

<p>I have heard that is not advised to use PHP 5.3 with Drupal, but I figure I will stick with what I had for tonight at least and see if I can get back to where I was.</p>

<p>Settings:</p>

<p>Apache v2.2 (running under user, NOT as service)</p>

<p>PHP 5.3</p>

<p>IngresII 9.3</p>
