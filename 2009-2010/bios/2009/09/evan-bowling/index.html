<p>I am a Computer Science senior at Michigan State University. I am excited to work with the Ingres team. I have had the chance to make use of open-source code and participate in the development conversations, but I am looking forward to actually contributing code.</p>

<p>Through various study abroad trips I discovered the field of geographic information science, or GIS. As I have taken coursework to earn a minor in this, I have learned that there are many technical problems that have parallels in computer science. I have a great interest in spatial problems ( not necessarily geographic ), which I think is because I am a very visual learner.</p>

<p>So this project really pulls at a lot of my interests and I am excited to get going!</p>

<p>P.S&gt; I won&#8217;t make it to Toronto until Saturday, but I am looking forward to meeting you all then.</p>

<p><strong>Check out my <a href="http://evanbowling.wordpress.com/2009/09/">blog</a> to see what I&#8217;m working on.</strong></p>
