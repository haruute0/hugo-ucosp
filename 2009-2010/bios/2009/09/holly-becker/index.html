  <p>Hey! I&#8217;m Holly Becker and I&#8217;m working on WikiDev.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m in my third year at SFU, majoring in Computer Science, like most of us here. My computer-related interests are mostly in operating systems, applications programming and networking, though most other aspects of computers interest me. It&#8217;s very exciting to be getting into the interesting upper-division computer courses.</p>

<p>This summer, I was a C++ programmer with a local games company, which was my first time programming in a production environment. It was quite an experience, and I look forward to this being my second.</p>

<p>While I may not be as experienced as many of the other UCOSP participants, I look forward to learning, and working with my teammates.</p>

<p>See you in Toronto!</p>
