<p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<p>My name is Diane Tam and I&#8217;ll be working on the ElmCity project.  I graduated from the Computer Science program at UofT about 3 years ago but recently developed a great interest in pursuing graduate studies in Computer Science.  As a result, I decided to come back to take some courses, specifically research related ones, to narrow down my field of interest and better prepare myself for graduate studies.</p>

<p>Upon graduation, I have been working full time as an applications developer at Oracle Corporation Canada and have been working there since.  I work mainly with Java, C++, and SQL on their On Demand hosted application development team.  I have had many opportunities to work on projects with teams, but I&#8217;m especially looking forward to working on ElmCity because it touches on Artificial Intelligence, which is a field I&#8217;m really interested in studying, and I never had the opportunity before as a student to work with other students in a setting such as this and I&#8217;m really excited to have this chance now to do so.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to all the learning experiences to gain from this project and meeting everyone soon!</p>
