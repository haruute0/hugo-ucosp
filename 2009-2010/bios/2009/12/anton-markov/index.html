<p>Hello everyone!</p>

<p>My name is Anton Markov, and I am a fourth-year Math student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science and Combinatorics &amp; Optimization. I will be working on the Mercurial project in the upcoming Winter 2010 term.</p>

<p> I am excited to be working on Mercurial for several reasons. First of all, Mercurial is a tool that I have personally used on a couple of co-op terms with great success. Second, I am looking forward to the opportunity of working with both low-level and high-level code in one project. Last but not least, I am excited to work with Benjamin Pollack from Fog Creek Software &#8211; a company that stands apart from the crowd.</p>

<p>A little information about myself: I have lived in Canada since 1996 when my family immigrated from Ukraine. I attended public school and high school in Toronto before moving out to Waterloo to study Computer Science. I&#8217;ve been tinkering with computers since, literally, before I had a computer! In my past co-op terms I&#8217;ve worked at two startups in Waterloo, and my current adventure has taken me to the west coast to intern at Microsoft.</p>

<p>My interests outside of computer science include reading (mostly sci-fi and fantasy), hiking, swimming, and playing my new XBox.</p>
