  <p>My name is Victoria Mui, and I&#8217;m a 4th year student currently completing my undergraduate specialist degree in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the University of Toronto.Â  This coming spring/winter term, I&#8217;ll be working on the user interface design of the MarkUs online marking tool.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m primarily a Java programmer, and I&#8217;ve made contributions to the Cytoscape open source community through the Google Summer of Code 2008 program under the mentorship of Professor Greg Wilson.Â  But I also have experience working with other programming languages like Python and C.</p>

<p>In addition to software development,Â  I also have strong interests in user experience design (UX) and human-computer interaction (HCI).Â  This past summer, I helped Professor Khai Truong with his HCI research on Upcycling.Â  And as of May 2009, I&#8217;ve been working full-time as a User-Centered Design Specialist at the IBM Toronto Lab.</p>

<p>I hope everybody is enjoying their winter holiday!Â  Looking forward to meeting everybody in January! ðŸ˜€</p>
