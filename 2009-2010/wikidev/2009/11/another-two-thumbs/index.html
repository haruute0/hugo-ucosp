  <p>Thumbs Up: Getting to work on an exploratory project, and seeing what it ended up becoming. WikiDev didn&#8217;t have as defined a goal at the start as most projects, but instead a framework to build on and ideas for where we could take things. After that, it was up to everyone to discuss every week and see where we wanted to go next. This was very enlightening and I enjoyed seeing how the project evolved as pieces were completed and we could see what our ideas were shaping up to look like. I am used to working on projects where the plan is fairly complete and spec&#8217;d out before any code is written, so this made for an interesting change of pace.</p>

<p>Thumb Down: Working on an exploratory project, especially for motivation and getting invested. The flip side of the coin is that with a less defined idea and direction, it was sometimes hard to see where each piece would fit into the whole. I always knew what I was working on at any given time, without knowing what was coming next or why it was important, I often had a nagging feeling that what I was working on would end up ignored and unused.</p>

<p>Overall, this was a great experience. The code sprint in Toronto was awesome, it was good to build real things in school for a change, and by the efforts of everyone involved it felt like much more than a simple course. I&#8217;d heartily recommend it for anyone else who gets the opportunity.</p>
