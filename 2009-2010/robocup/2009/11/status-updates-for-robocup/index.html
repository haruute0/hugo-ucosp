  <p>We had our <a href="http://chani.ca/robocup/minutes/22_nov_minutes.rtf">meeting</a> on Sunday, November 22. Here is what the team had been up to:</p>

<p>Alex</p>

<p>&#8211; worked on passing, now it takes into account players from the opposit team</p>

<p>&#8211; it is hard to make 100% accurate passing because of the noise added to the measurements</p>

<p>Next task:</p>

<p>&#8211; work on interception as it is related to passing</p>

<p>Chani</p>

<p>&#8211; fixed code so that now players are using data from the current tick</p>

<p>&#8211; fixed a bug in the debug ui</p>

<p>Next task:</p>

<p>&#8211; continue debugging</p>

<p>Ioana</p>

<p>&#8211; worked on dribbling</p>

<p>&#8211; found bug that causes a player to be stuck near the ball not making any actions</p>

<p>possible reason is that position of the player and the ball is not update properly</p>

<p>Next task:</p>

<p>&#8211; continue working on dribbling</p>

<p>Yulia</p>

<p>&#8211; rewrote chunk of code responsible for parsing the s-expressions from the server</p>

<p>&#8211; slightly improved the accuracy of statistics computed from the server data</p>

<p>but it seems that there is not much we can do to make it better because of the</p>

<p>server restrictions</p>

<p>Next task:</p>

<p>&#8211; continue debugging</p>

<p>Patrik</p>

<p>&#8211; did a merge of code from the dt branch into trunk</p>

<p>Next task:</p>

<p>&#8211; debugging kick/dribbling</p>
