  <p><strong>Nikita</strong></p>

<p>Status:</p>

<p>+documenting and testing remote.py, batch.py (this leaves us with no &#8220;big&#8221; modules untested, rotate.py and event.py can</p>

<p>be done quickly later on).</p>

<ul>
<li>timezone had to be revisited and changed a bit (timezone_source, timezone_dest), and together with other little things
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>we officially announced the new features to the community</p>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<p>&#8211; I&#8217;ve been sick for the past couple of days, so things are moving a bit slower for me than usual.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not a real roadblock, just letting everyone know why I was semi-silent since Friday.</p>

<p>&#8211; we need to adopt development / stable scheme on the web server, Jory what&#8217;s the status on that one?</p>

<p>&#8211; tests are not working for one of the plugins and for the integration testing, Meghan, Jack what&#8217;s the status</p>

<p>on those ones? It&#8217;s not a major roadblock per se (the problems are with the test code itself, not with the</p>

<p>project&#8217;s code), but it&#8217;d be nice if they worked.</p>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<p>I want to concentrate on the patterns and generalized plugin from now on, spending much less time</p>

<p>on the service as a whole, after all we have a stable version in the repos right now and the next</p>

<p>big step is the generalized plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Diane</strong></p>

<p>Status:</p>

<p>&#8211; Refined a generic plugin that can parse some pages successfully.  Latest plugins have been delivered to google code repository.</p>

<p>&#8211; Continually working towards generalizing the scraper to scrape multiple sites.</p>

<p>&#8211; Documenting patterns through blog and tester.  Latest post in regards to plugin and patterns can be found here: <a title="Patterns and thoughts continued" href="http://dianetam.com/dev/blog/2009/11/05/patterns-and-thoughts-continued/" target="_blank"><a href="http://dianetam.com/dev/blog/2009/11/05/patterns-and-thoughts-continued/">http://dianetam.com/dev/blog/2009/11/05/patterns-and-thoughts-continued/</a></a></p>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<p>&#8211; Work, classes.</p>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<p>&#8211; Continue to scrape and document patterns found from event sites.</p>

<p>&#8211; Establish a more complete analysis of the patterns found from the fuse-cal parsed pages as well as the sample pages curators have pointed to.</p>

<p>&#8211; Divide the list according to the patterns found and manage the lists (ie. through Delicious tags).</p>

<p>&#8211; Populate that dictionary for all our targets plus the ones the curators have added to our list.</p>

<p>&#8211; Build a tester that will accept the various patterns and extract appropriate information from them</p>
