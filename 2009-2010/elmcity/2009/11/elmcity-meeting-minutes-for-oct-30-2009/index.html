  <p>On Friday, the Elmcity team had its weekly meeting, the minutes of which can be found <a href="http://jorygraham.com/elmcity/2009-10-30.153659-0400EDT.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>A summary of the things we covered:</p>

<p>We went over and finalized our <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/marking-scheme-for-elmcity-project/">grading scheme</a>, including exactly what functionality we hope to have achieved by the 29th of November.</p>

<p>In that vein, we&#8217;ve decided that our functionality will primarily be dictated by the ability to parse the pages brought up by our users <a href="http://friendfeed.com/elmcity/92ef3b61/hey-everyone-team-over-in-elmcity-development">here</a>, and secondarily by this <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2009/07/07/strategic-choices-for-calendar-publishers/">list</a>. There&#8217;s a lot of overlap between the two, but our focus is on the sites the current curators are interested in.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve all been looking over the patterns that should be recognized by our general parser, and will report on them this week.</p>

<p>Finally, we discussed which approach should be taken for parsing based on two libraries available for python: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/parsedatetime/0.8.4">parsedatetime</a> and <a href="http://labix.org/python-dateutil">dateutil</a>. Dateutil seems to err on the side of caution, choking on any non-datetime text; whereas parsedatetime can handle a really wide range, but will also return false positives. We&#8217;ll likely have to take a middle ground approach to our parsing, since human generated text is so unpredictable.</p>
