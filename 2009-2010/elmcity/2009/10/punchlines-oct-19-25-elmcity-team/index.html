<p>Status:</p>

<p>&#8211; The project I was working on got canned, so I&#8217;m trying to get reacquainted with the core codebase</p>

<p>&#8211; Also trying to understand the intended goals and power structure of this project better so I don&#8217;t waste more work. This entails some discussion, new use of the bug tracking system for laying out goals, and group formulation of user stories (to be finished at this Friday&#8217;s meeting)</p>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<p>&#8211; Midterms</p>

<p>&#8211; If we write user stories as a group on Friday without Jon, how do we make sure he clears each one, and what do we do if he rejects many of them? I&#8217;m concerned this could make Friday&#8217;s meeting less useful than it otherwise would be. Alternatives: Solicit a comprehensive description of what Jon thinks are acceptable high-level goals before Friday and refine at the meeting, adding no additional ideas so we don&#8217;t stray from spec, or, better, have Jon come to the meeting if possible.</p>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<p>&#8211; Write documentation</p>

<p>&#8211; Write tests, and add any bugs I discover to bug tracker</p>

<p>&#8211; Choose all future tasks from the bug tracker for better directed work</p>

<p>&#8211; Turn agreed-upon and authorised user stories into a series of milestones specified in the bug tracker, choose one as a milestone for one or two weeks from now</p>

<p>&#8211; Use user stories generated plus group discussion to formulate marking scheme</p>

<p>Status:</p>

<p>&#8211; <a href="http://elmcity.cloudapp.net/services/frenchThings/html">http://elmcity.cloudapp.net/services/frenchThings/html</a> (different types of feeds showing up!)</p>

<p>&#8211; removed all relative links in the code, which now allows us to check out code and develop locally much easialy</p>

<p>&#8211; added filtering ability to the service (url=&#8230;&amp;filter=Montreal)</p>

<p>&#8211; rewrote librarything plugin to use RSS instead of HTML when parsing events</p>

<p>&#8211; myspace (fixed issue #36, choking on certain pages with missing location information)</p>

<p>&#8211; tests: wrote tests and docuemnted myspace, librarything, database.py, added test_all.py (that creates a test suite from available test modules and runs them all)</p>

<p>&#8211; wrote initial batch module (batch.py)</p>

<p>&#8211; started two wiki pages (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmcity/w/list">http://code.google.com/p/elmcity/w/list</a>) one for &#8220;how to write a plugin&#8221;, the other one describing the general look of the system.</p>

<p>&#8211; other little things</p>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<p>&#8211; none</p>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<p>&#8211; looking and coming up with the solution for the timezone problem (as per <a href="http://friendfeed.com/elmcity-development/735c49eb/problem-with-librarything-approach">http://friendfeed.com/elmcity-development/735c49eb/problem-with-librarything-approach</a>) and</p>

<p>AM/PM problem (as per <a href="http://friendfeed.com/elmcity-development/abbbced4/paris-est-belle">http://friendfeed.com/elmcity-development/abbbced4/paris-est-belle</a>)</p>

<p>&#8211; pluginFinder.py, icwWriter &#8211; documentation, unit tests</p>

<p>not-so-important:</p>

<p>&#8211; move views.py code into a separate file, and make views.py call it from there (this is to enforce independence from django)</p>

<p>&#8211; extending web-interface</p>

<p>&#8211; more things if time permits!</p>

<p><strong>more to come</strong></p>
