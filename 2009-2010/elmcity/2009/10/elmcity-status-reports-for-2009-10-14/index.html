  <p>I haven&#8217;t heard back from the whole team, but here are the status reports I did receive:</p>

<p><strong>Jory</strong></p>

<p>Status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented the SQL layer in database.py by&#8230;</li>
<li>Restructuring and refactoring icsWriter.py and remote.py</li>
</ul>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don&#8217;t have any unit or integration tests, so it&#8217;s impossible to be completely reassured with code changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write integration tests for database.py?</li>
<li>Write unit tests for remote.py</li>
<li>Further restructuring of remote.py</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Diane</strong></p>

<p>Status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Still working on cataloguing what sorts of general patters we should support.  Expect to have results by the end of the week.</li>
<li>Setting up Cathy Levinson&#8217;s elmcity wordpress plugin (Calendar Display Mechanisms) and investigating how to divide the work between the elmcity service and the plugin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>None.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Continue working on the cataloguing of general patterns found within existing FuseCal-parsed pages.  Expect to have results published by the end of the week.</li>
<li>Look into how the elmcity wordpress plugin is sourcing JSON and how client-side rendering directly in the elmcity service might be more useful and how it may not be.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Nikita</strong></p>

<p>Status:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wrote remote.py</li>
<li>Implemented bad_urls table</li>
<li>Wrote up about the project page, with simple instructions on how to use the service</li>
<li>Restructured hg repository so that it&#8217;s now mirror of our server structure</li>
<li>Updated ajax interface &amp; frontend so it doesn&#8217;t choke on malformed URLs</li>
</ul>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>None</li>
</ul>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add filter capability to the service</li>
<li>Write-up &#8220;how to write a plugin&#8221; plugins guidelines</li>
<li>Write batch processing module</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sarah</strong></p>

<p>Status:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m looking into Autopager, a firefox plugin that does a very good job of allowing users to generate rules to select different parts of a page.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m reading through the source code and sketching out some ideas as to how a plugin generator for us would look, how to make the interface more usable, and what extra features we&#8217;d need.</li>
</ul>

<p>Roadblocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Waiting for answer from developer of whether Autopager is free for reuse with modification, or just open source</li>

<li><p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure whether this side project is a good use of team resources: Would a complementary generator to Diane&#8217;s project be worthwhile?</p></li>

<li><p>I was trying to wait until I had something more concrete to blog about it, but I could really use some input from the rest of the team</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Next Steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I&#8217;ll put together a UCOSP Elmcity ics with the meetings, this weekly post, and other events &#8211; if nothing else, it&#8217;d help me stay on top of things.</p></li>

<li><p>I&#8217;ll make a blog post about this idea, and solicit opinions from the rest of the group.</p></li>

<li><p>Search for and blog about the question: what is fair use for open source but not free software? Can I dissect Autopager&#8217;s approach in detail, throw away their code, and write from a guideline I got from their source? Can I look through Autopager&#8217;s source when I hit a design problem, and implement their solution &#8220;in my own words&#8221;? Or am I not really allowed to make what would be conceptually a derivitive work if I&#8217;ve read their code? I&#8217;m sure a lot of people working on UCOSP could help me with this.</p></li>
</ul>
