  <p>At the amazing code sprint, we became familiar with our teammates, git and Reviewboard and now after the kick-off, we begin to dive into Reviewboard.</p>

<p>It is first step that costs troublesome, especially when there are quite a lot of new stuffs (e.g. python, django, git, Reviewboard, etc ) Sometimes we don’t know where to go and sometimes we mess up the code. Fortunately, there are people we know we can turn to for help—our mentors! Q&amp;A on IRC channel works efficient and weekly meetings are helpful too. We are learning by screwing up, searching, questioning and fixing.</p>

<p>Everyone in the team, have set one’s own project development plans including development strategies and milestones. And so far, we have had some progress:</p>

<p>• Steve is working on Scalability Testing Tools to help test the product, having fun with database. He also presented a presentation about Reviewboard to his university.</p>

<p>• Teresa, on editable theme support, have already built a simple Themes tab with a bunch of CharFields for editable options and is going to work out a color-selector.</p>

<p>• Kahlil is learning about extension and is now able to add buttons in the review area. He is planning to learn more about it and XML framework.</p>

<p>• Crystal, though is still recovering from illness and busy with midterms, spend much time on how the Quick Search Feature is going to work and reading lots on REST API.</p>

<p>• Mark looked into the post-commit UI but found it might not work out with just him. He is changing his project.</p>

<p>• Mengyun read about spell checking and tried to find out a way to implement it for Reviewboard. She is planning to build a demo one in the following weeks and improve it.</p>

<p>Working with Reviewboard is a kind of challenge but we do feel productive and interesting during these weeks. We’re looking forward to making some effective contribution to Reviewboard in the remainder of the semester!</p>
