  <h1><a href="https://haruute0.github.io/hugo-ucosp/2009-2010/uncategorized/2011/01/eol-team-dives-into-testing/" title="EOL team dives into testing">EOL team dives into testing</a></h1>
  <p>So we&#8217;re the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) team: Josh (University of</p>

<p>Toronto), Jonathan (Ottawa University), Feng (York University), Tyler</p>

<p>and Will (both at Laurentian University) and our mentor is Dmitry</p>

<p>Mozzherin who is a programmer at Encyclopedia of Life.</p>

<p>Our project is to develop a general testing framework for the EOL</p>

<p>website &#8211; a site that is attempting to catalog every species on the</p>

<p>planet &#8211; with the intent that this framework be general enough to use</p>

<p>for any given website. We&#8217;re using a stack of technologies to</p>

<p>implement this goal:</p>

<p>Cucumber (<a href="http://cukes.info">http://cukes.info</a>) is a behaviour driven development testing</p>

<p>framework developed in Ruby. It allows a programmer to describe what a</p>

<p>particular feature is intended to perform in plain English, and given</p>

<p>a set of underlying &#8216;step definitions&#8217; defined in Ruby, a test is</p>

<p>performed based on the plain English.</p>

<p>Selenium (<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/">http://seleniumhq.org/</a>) is an automated way to control a web</p>

<p>browser and ensure that the behaviour of a website is correct.</p>

<p>Capybara (<a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara</a>) is a Ruby based driver</p>

<p>for the new version of Selenium. Our goal is to integrate Cucumber and</p>

<p>Capybara in such a way that automated tests can be performed using the</p>

<p>plain English descriptions mentioned above.</p>

<p>The potential benefits to combining these technologies are huge. Using</p>

<p>this software stack it should be possible to create an automated</p>

<p>testing framework that can be implemented in plain English and in a</p>

<p>generic way so that it can be used to test any website. The most</p>

<p>intriguing part of this whole project is that it is being started from</p>

<p>scratch. One of the administrators of the program noted that it was</p>

<p>almost unheard of for this to happen for Capstone projects but this</p>

<p>project seemed like a natural evolution from the current EOL testing</p>

<p>framework fit well with EOL&#8217;s goals.</p>

<p>Our time at the code sprint was spent for the most part getting</p>

<p>acquainted with Git, Ruby and the above technologies. Once we got</p>

<p>everything working in harmony we spent some time putting together some</p>

<p>initial tests which we&#8217;ll be able to use as templates for the bulk of</p>

<p>the work ahead us. The last day of the code sprint was spent dividing</p>

<p>up the work using the GitHub issue tracker which looks like it will be</p>

<p>an efficient way of distributing labour.</p>
