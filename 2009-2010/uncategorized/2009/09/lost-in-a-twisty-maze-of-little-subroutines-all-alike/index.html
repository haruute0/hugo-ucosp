  <p>Many great computer scientists and educators have observed that while we teach students to write code, we don&#8217;t teach them to read it [<a href="#1">1</a>]. When you think about it, it&#8217;s ridiculous: architects study hundreds of buildings before designing one of their own, novelist probably read <em>thousands</em> of books before trying to create their own masterpiece [<a href="#2">2</a>], and only mathematicians can count how many proofs they go through in detail during their training, so why don&#8217;t programmers study great programs to improve their craft?</p>

<p>One of the few people who&#8217;s actually done something about this is Diomidis Spinellis. His two books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Reading-Open-Source-Perspective/dp/0201799405"><em>Code Reading</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Code-Quality-Open-Source-Perspective/dp/0321166078"><em>Code Quality</em></a> are respectively an explanation of how to read large C/C++ programs meant to build and run on Unix, and how to tell good code from bad code. Both are worth reading, as is his <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/">blog</a>.Â  Just last week, for example, he described <a href="http://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20090916/">how he tracked down a bug in a regular expression library</a>. I tried to do something last year when I recorded myself <a href="http://www.third-bit.com/pages/reviewing-markdown.html">reading through a medium-sized piece of Python</a>. I&#8217;d be very interested in pointers to similar material, i.e., to examples of people reading and reviewing code in public.</p>

<p>[<a name="1">1</a>] I&#8217;ll award 5 millimarks each to the first three people to find quotes online to back this up.</p>

<p>[<a name="2">2</a>] Though in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/6194031/The-Lost-Symbol-and-The-Da-Vinci-Code-author-Dan-Browns-20-worst-sentences.html">Dan Brown&#8217;s case</a>, it doesn&#8217;t appear to have helped.</p>
