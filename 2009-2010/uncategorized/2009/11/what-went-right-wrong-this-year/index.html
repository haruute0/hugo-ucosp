  <p>Thumbs up: Sponsors, I liked the fact that we were able to get further acquainted with  large businesses in the computer science field such as Ingres, Tucows, Yahoo, and Rogers Communication. I also agree with Greg&#8217;s point, and it was a good learning experience to work on projects in a different setting and environment.</p>

<p>Thumbs down: Though this may have  been expensive, I would&#8217;ve liked to have a UCOSP meeting like the initial sprint at the end of this experience to wrap up the project. I think this would also be helpful to gauge experiences and follow-up on progress and accomplishments of other teams. Writing about it is good but I think just as in the sprint, face to face communication is essential</p>
