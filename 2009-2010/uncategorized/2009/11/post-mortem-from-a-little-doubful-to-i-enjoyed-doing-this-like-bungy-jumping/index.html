  <p><strong>Thumbs up:</strong> Learning skills and applying them to complete daily project tasks. Like the old saying goes, its like killing two birds with one stone, learning all these new technical/non technical skills that will look pretty good in a resume and completing a great project and getting credits for it, hence making progress in terms of school credits. This was a very rewarding experience, with a great team, if it was not for other school commitments I would do it again</p>

<p><strong>Thumbs down:</strong> A lot of ideas pending coding, at-least there is a bit of documentation which I believe can prove to be helpful for the next people who continue with the project.</p>
