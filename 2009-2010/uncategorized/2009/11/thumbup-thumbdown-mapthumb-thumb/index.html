  <h1><a href="https://haruute0.github.io/hugo-ucosp/2009-2010/uncategorized/2009/11/thumbup-thumbdown-mapthumb-thumb/" title="[thumbUp, thumbDown].map{&amp;#124;thumb&amp;#124; thumb&#43;&#43;}">[thumbUp, thumbDown].map{&amp;#124;thumb&amp;#124; thumb&#43;&#43;}</a></h1>
  <p><strong>ThumbUp: <em>peer reviews</em></strong>. Peer reviews, at least for the Basie team, was certainly a new type of experience in software development. It promoted communication between the team, getting into each other&#8217;s code, writing code that is good enough for others to look at, and then still getting feedback on how to improve it. It creates a better <em>&#8220;team&#8221;</em> feeling, than simply having a group of people commit to the same source code repository.</p>

<p><strong>ThumbDown: <em>peer reviews</em></strong>. As good as they were, peer reviews also left a lot more to be desired. It is certainly a different experience now, than at the beginning of the term when most new members on the project were intimidated to both comment on other people&#8217;s code or even have their code be looked at by someone else. I think in the future, it might be a good idea to force the students to break some comfort zones sooner. I would have also liked to see more back&amp;forth <em>discussion</em> of design/performance considerations, rather than one-sided comments on the use of language&#8217;s style guidelines.</p>
