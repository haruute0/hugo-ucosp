  <p>The Good:</p>

<p>It was nice to learn how people are using tools like <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> to interact directly with their end-users. I know there are a lot of solutions to that specific problem, but my experience with large scale work in the past had only ever been internal projects.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>Lack of direction. I understand that this wasn&#8217;t really a problem for a lot of the projects, but I feel that ours suffered it in spades. We didn&#8217;t have a shareholder who was really hands-on and invested in what we were doing.</p>
