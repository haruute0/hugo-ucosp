  <p>My QA teacher recently pointed us to the following <a href="http://people.canonical.com/~ianc/papers/community-agile/community-agile.html">interesting paper</a>. It describes a process framework for development in a distributed (optionally open-source) context. They call it <em>Community-Agile software guidance</em>.</p>

<p>Though no single process framework can apply to every projects, you&#8217;ll find that many recommendations in that paper are nowadays must-follow rules (those regarding quality in particular). I also like the way the author presents growing software as compared to a living creature that ought to be surrounded by an appropriate community in order to fully blossom and how that software needs to be <em>guided</em> toward maturity as it grows.</p>

<p>I believe it is a must-read to all of us doing distributed open-source development. Hope you enjoy as much as I did.</p>
