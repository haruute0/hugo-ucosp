  <p>This week is another productive week for Thunderbird Team in that most of us have finished most of their work!</p>

<p><strong>Wei Xian</strong> has resolved his bug (restore session) and his patch has been pushed to comm-central. Also, he is going to prepare a &#8220;quick start guide&#8221; for future students who are going to work on Thunderbird. For myself, I have posted my revised patch and get the review from Blake. Now I have submitted a secondary review request and hopefully everything is going all right.Â  <strong>Evan</strong> is working on his own <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2425" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2425">RFC 2425</a> parser to provide (de-)serialization of <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2425" title="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2425">RFC 2425</a> directory entries into a data structure designed to support simple lookups on types and parameters. Now he is waiting for his patches to be reviewed. <strong>Zach</strong> is working on applying his patch and running mozmill test on his machine. There are still some issues for me to handle with the testing. <strong>Lindauson</strong> is still working on the menu items and seeking suggestions.</p>
