  <h1><a href="https://haruute0.github.io/hugo-ucosp/2009-2010/uncategorized/2010/04/evaluation/" title="Evaluation">Evaluation</a></h1>
  <p>Almost all of this term&#8217;s students have sent in their self-evaluations, and their evaluations of their mentors. Overall, people seem to have enjoyed working on things that are actually going to be used, and getting to know their peers and their industry mentors. There are a few things we need to do better next time&#8212;clearer goals for some projects, some grades midway through term so that people know where they stand, etc.&#8212;but I think we all deserve an &#8216;A&#8217; for what we accomplished.</p>

<p>Best of luck with exams (for those of you who still have them); I hope to have the chance to work with you again some day.</p>
