  <p>Apologies this is coming late, I didn&#8217;t notice I was set as the blog poster for this week!</p>

<p>It seems like several of us are having difficulties with unit tests, with myself and <strong>Zach</strong> having trouble getting working unit tests off the ground, and <strong>Wei Xian</strong> adding some polish to his previous unit tests.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>Tim</strong> and I are feeling the crunch of other courses so haven&#8217;t been productive over the last week.</p>

<p>Many of us, including <strong>Kefu</strong>, <strong>Tim</strong>, <strong>Evan</strong>, and <strong>Wei Xian</strong> have been working hard with Mozilla reviewers to make changes to their code. It&#8217;s nice to see that the project as a whole places such emphasis on code quality and correctness, and we&#8217;re all learning a lot from what they are telling us to do!</p>

<p>And of course, while working on tests and getting past code reviews, some of us are trucking along working on other tasks &#8211; <strong>Lindauson</strong> is hard at work trying to get menu items to behave the way he wants them to, <strong>Wei Xian</strong> is working on standalone message window behaviour, and I am working on listening to folder compacting events so that they properly display themselves in the activity manager.</p>
