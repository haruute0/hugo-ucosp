  <p>During our last meeting past Monday, we discussed where everybody was and what they were doing. We also solved some problems during the conversation. This is what everyone is doing so far.</p>

<p>Max is working on virtual environment and git clone.</p>

<p>Fatima is working on build-coverage and hgClone.</p>

<p>Jacob is working on improving the user interface.</p>

<p>Khushboo is working on build-nose and svn.</p>

<p>Fatima and I are still having some problems getting the builds running. Even though we solved it during the meeting, we are still getting problems even after correcting the pony-client.</p>

<p>Rose joined us during the conversation and has been really helpful all the time.</p>
