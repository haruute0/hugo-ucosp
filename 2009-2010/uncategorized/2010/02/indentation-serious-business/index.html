  <p>The pony-build team just had our weekly meeting the other night and the following is what people have been working on:</p>

<p>1) Jack has been working on some command line stuff. You can follow his thread <a href="http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/pony-build/2010-February/000042.html">here</a>, for descriptions of his changes as well as what he is planning to tackle next.</p>

<p>2) Fatima has been working on getting her coverage build script finished up and working, as well as refining the HgClone implementation in the pony-build client.
