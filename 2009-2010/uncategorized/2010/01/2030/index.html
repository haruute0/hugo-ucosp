<p>No, not my blog &#8212; I&#8217;m not that modest &#8212; but good words nonetheless :).</p>

<p>And the post he cited included the lines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The kind of practice where all of a sudden I realize that it is 2am and I’m exhausted physically so I should go to bed, but mentally I feel on fire so I let the code have me for another hour or two (I imagine this state to be like a marathon runner or ironman near the end of their race).</p>

<p>Well &#8230; no.  Studies of highly-productive writers have shown that they establish a regular, sustainable pace of writing.  That includes deliberately stopping <em>before</em> they get exhausted, confident that they&#8217;ll be able to resume the next day with only a small productivity loss due to context switch.  Although these studies were done on writers of natural language, I have every reason to believe they apply to productive coders as well.</p>

<p>Becoming skilled at programming, like gaining skill at any difficult task, takes long practice, sustained over months and years, and at a pace that allows you to remain healthy&#8212;mentally, physically, and socially.   It&#8217;s not like running a marathon (the original author&#8217;s metaphor) so much as it&#8217;s like <em>training</em> to run a marathon.  You prepare by running sub-marathon distances, regularly, training over an extended period.</p>
