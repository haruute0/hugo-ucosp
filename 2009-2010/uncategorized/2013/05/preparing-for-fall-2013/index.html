  <p>While students are enjoying a summer away from school (or at least that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to think you are doing), we are putting all the pieces in place for UCOSP next year.</p>

<p>We had a very successful year with students from 25 Canadian universities participating. The enthusiasm and energy that students and mentors brought to the code sprints in Waterloo and Menlo Park was fantastic.</p>

<p>We recently learned that Google will once again be our primary sponsor. Without their continued support, UCOSP could not have grown in the program that we have today.</p>

<p>In the fall, we are thrilled to announce that Mozilla will be hosting the sprint in downtown Toronto. They have a great space and lots of expertise on site.</p>

<p>We are still working on plans for the January code sprint, but we hope to team up again with the great program that Jay Borenstein from Stanford is running.</p>

<p>We are also still working on finalizing the set of projects for next year, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>So, if you are a CS student at a Canadian university talk to your department to learn how to apply to participate.</p>
