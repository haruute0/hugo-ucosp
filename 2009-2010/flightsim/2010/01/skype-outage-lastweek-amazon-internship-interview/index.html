  <p>In the flight sim team we relied on skype for all non-verbal communication. It so happened that there is a <a href="http://twitter.com/Skype/status/8035128397">global skype outage</a> last Thursday right which happed to collide with our weekly team meeting&#8217;s time. (Good thing that we are using IBM&#8217;s conferce call infrastructure for our meeting.) <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> again proved to be the best way to look for outage information like these &#8211; a quick search for the #Skype hash tag quickly revealed to me that a lot of people are having the same problem, and eventually leads me to the official <a href="http://twitter.com/Skype">@Skype</a> Twitter account. Although they didn&#8217;t provide any solution but at least you know they&#8217;re working on it. So&#8230; if anything happens next time, give Twitter a try.</p>

<p>In unrelated news, I had an <a href="http://www.chancancode.com/2010/01/25/amazon-internship-interview/">internship phone interview</a> with <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> today. While I can&#8217;t tell you the exact questions that I was asked, I can tell you that they <em>love</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">trees</a>. It really pays to know you data structures well! (I wish I know it better before I picked up the phone&#8230;) So&#8230; if you&#8217;re having an internship interview anytime soon, go pick up your DS textbook and make sure you know it inside out!</p>
