  <p>I <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2010/01/27/all-nighters-lower-your-grades/">posted a link</a> last week to Evan Robinson&#8217;s article explaining <a href="http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons">why crunch mode doesn&#8217;t work</a>. Coincidentally, Ruben Ortega&#8217;s latest post on the ACM site asks, Why Do Software Developers Tolerate &#8220;Crunch Time&#8221;? His answer is &#8220;progress&#8221;, or at least, developers&#8217; need to feel like they&#8217;re making progress. A couple of paragraphs later, though, he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is unrealistic to deliver any project without going through some &#8220;Crunch time.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally think <em>that</em> is the root of the problem. If you believe broken builds are inevitable, you&#8217;re not going to work very hard to make sure that code always compiles. If you believe that users are dumb, you&#8217;re not going to put much effort into fixing your user interface. And if you believe that it&#8217;s unrealistic to deliver code without all-nighters, guess what? You&#8217;re going to wind up pulling all-nighters.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s <em>my</em> data. I haven&#8217;t stayed up to see the sunrise since the night my daughter was born, and you&#8217;d have to go back at least 15 years before that to my previous all-nighter. Despite that&#8212;no, <em>because of</em> that&#8212;I get a fair bit done on time and on spec. My algorithm is pretty simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>List the things that need to be done.</li>
<li>Figure out which ones really matter, and which ones don&#8217;t.</li>
<li>Estimate how long each one is going to take.</li>
<li>Sort.</li>
<li>Start work.</li>
</ol>

<p>For every thing I do, there&#8217;s a dozen that I set aside. I always feel a pang of regret (sometimes two), but trying to do everything is a good way to accomplish nothing. And while it took me twenty years to learn how, I&#8217;m not pretty good at abandoning things that are half done if it turns out that they&#8217;re not as important, or as doable, as I thought they were. (&#8220;I&#8217;ve started so I&#8217;ll finish&#8221; sounds macho, but it&#8217;s lousy project management.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also learned to ask people, &#8220;Is this a good idea?&#8221; <em>before</em> I put too much work into it. This one was hard too; I&#8217;ve always enjoyed walking into a room and saying, &#8220;Ta da, look what I&#8217;ve done!&#8221; These days, though, I&#8217;ll ask my wife or a fellow prof or a student what they think before I start writing or coding. As my dad used to say, &#8220;A week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>So: what&#8217;s <em>your</em> strategy for getting things done? How well does it work? And do you think you&#8217;re getting better at it?</p>
