  <p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/bad-habits-and-more-than-a-little-marketing/">written</a> <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com/2009/08/15/software-engineering-as-a-human-activity/">earlier</a>, an increasing amount of research in software engineering is focused on empirical studies of what actually works (or doesn&#8217;t) in the real world. A <a href="http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MS.2009.114">new paper</a> from Moe, Dingsøyr, and Dybå reports a multi-year study of teams in several companies implementing Scrum. Key problems they identified include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Over-specialization: if each module &#8220;belongs&#8221; to one developer, it&#8217;s hard for the group as a whole to design and plan, because no one knows enough to get a big picture view.</li>
<li>Unclear completion criteria: if team members don&#8217;t know how to tell when something&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s difficult for them to plan and prioritize.</li>
<li>Meetings that are not engaging: self-explanatory.</li>
<li>Lack of team autonomy: in particular, if managers constantly come along and say, &#8220;Never mind the plan, fixing this bug is now your top priority,&#8221; people stop caring about making plans in the first place.</li>
<li>Impression management: if managers give <em>their</em> managers the impression that a team is better than it actually is, then the team will be given goals that are impossible to meet.</li>
<li>Resource contention: developers who are working on two or more projects in parallel always have to decide who to disappoint.  (Note: students are usually working on five courses at once&#8230;)</li>
</ul>

<p>The paper suggests solutions for all of these problems, but they basically come down to &#8220;use common sense&#8221;.  It&#8217;ll be interesting at the end of term to see which of the traps on this list we&#8217;ve fallen into, and whether we can improve next time &#8217;round.</p>
