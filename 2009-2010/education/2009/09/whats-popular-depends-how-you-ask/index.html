  <p>An ex-student of mine is trying to decide what web technology to use in the project he&#8217;s about to start working on.  The three choices are Java plus some kind of framework, Django and Python (which he knows very well), or Ruby on Rails (which he doesn&#8217;t, but could pick up quickly).  The argument in favor of Java plus whatever is that his employer is sure to be able to hire good Java programmers at a reasonable price for the next decade, but as he points out, doing small or medium-sized project in Java takes longer and hurts more than doing it in a dynamic language like Python or Ruby.</p>

<p>But what about Django vs. Rails? Is one more widely used than the other?  That&#8217;s usually a pretty good guide to how easy it will be to hire programmers who already know it [1], and how quickly libraries or adapters for [name of next year&#8217;s hot new technology goes here] appear for it.</p>

<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve relied on book sales, or even just the number of books on a topic, to tell me how much programmers care about something. My ex-student tried something else: a <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=django%2C+ruby+rails&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">Google Trends query</a> comparing &#8220;django&#8221; with &#8220;ruby rails&#8221;:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-597" title="first" src="http://ucosp.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/first.png" alt="first" width="580" height="260" srcset="http://ucosp.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/first.png 580w, http://ucosp.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/first-300x134.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>

<p>I was very surprised: my impression had been that Ruby on Rails was much more widely used than Django. But then I looked at the query itself a little more closely, and decided to try two others. The <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=rails%2C+django&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">first</a> compares &#8220;rails&#8221; to &#8220;django&#8221;:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598" title="second" src="http://ucosp.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/second.png" alt="second" width="580" height="260" srcset="http://ucosp.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/second.png 580w, http://ucosp.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/second-300x134.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very different answer, but looking at the results, it&#8217;s also untrustworthy, since &#8220;rails&#8221; includes web traffic about trains. How about <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=ruby+rails%2C+python+django&amp;ctab=0&amp;geo=all&amp;date=all&amp;sort=0">trying</a> &#8220;ruby rails&#8221; vs. &#8220;python django&#8221;:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-599" title="third" src="http://ucosp.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/third.png" alt="third" width="580" height="260" srcset="http://ucosp.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/third.png 580w, http://ucosp.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/third-300x134.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></p>

<p>Which is the &#8220;right&#8221; answer? I have no idea. The last one corresponds most closely with my preconceptions, but I&#8217;ve been bitten enough times to recognize <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> when I commit it :-). <a href="http://unspace.ca/innovation/pubnite">Rails Pub Night</a> in Toronto draws ten to twenty times as many people as meetings of the <a href="http://pygta.vrplumber.com/">Toronto Python Users&#8217; Group</a>, but again, that&#8217;s not necessarily an indication of who&#8217;s using Django.</p>

<p>What else would <em>you</em> try to figure it out?</p>

<p>[1] Yes, a good programmer can learn a new language in a couple of weeks, but mastering a web framework and the dozens of modules needed to build an industrial-grade app takes a lot longer&#8212;it&#8217;s like the difference between being able to ask where the bathroom is and being able to discuss literature.</p>
