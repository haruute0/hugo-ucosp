  <p>Few topics in programming generate as much argument and as little value as wrangles over where the curly braces should go in C programs, or whether CamelCaseNames or pothole_case_names are better [<a href="#1">1</a>]. That said, consistency definitely matters&#8212;plenty of studies have shown that MiXiNg <em>styles</em> <strong>disrupts</strong> comprehension&#8212;so having a style guide and sticking to it is more important than what the style guide actually says.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m therefore grateful that Google has started <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/">posting its style guides</a> for all to read. If your project doesn&#8217;t already have one, and you&#8217;re using a platform Google cares about, adopting theirs is probably the least painful way possible to solve one of the many startup challenges you face.</p>

<p>[<a name="1">1</a>] Short answer: a study in the late 1970s seemed to show that pothole_case was slightly more readable for people who&#8217;d learned English as a second language, but both the effect and the sample size were too small to be reliable.</p>
