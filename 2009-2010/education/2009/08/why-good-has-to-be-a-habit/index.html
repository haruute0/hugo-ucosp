  <p>A <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/MindMoodNews/story?id=8211974&amp;page=1">new study</a> shows that the more stressed you are, the more likely you are to rely on habits instead of thinking through what&#8217;s best for your actual situation. (OK, it actually shows that for rats, but it&#8217;s easy to believe that the results apply to human beings as well.) As Dave Rooney explains in <a href="http://practicalagility.blogspot.com/2009/06/revert-to-training.html">a recent blog post</a>, this is why you have to drill and drill until doing the right thing <em>is</em> your habit: if you don&#8217;t, then when the going gets rough, you&#8217;ll revert to your earlier (and probably less productive) training, which will then increase your stress, and down you go. One of the goals for these projects is to shift everyone to good habits as early in the term as possible, even if they seem like overkill at the time, so that when the end-of-term crunch arrives, things won&#8217;t fall apart.</p>
