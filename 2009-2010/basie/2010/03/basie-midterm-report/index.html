  <h1><a href="https://haruute0.github.io/hugo-ucosp/2009-2010/basie/2010/03/basie-midterm-report/" title="Basie Midterm Report">Basie Midterm Report</a></h1>
  <p>The Basie team has made considerable progress this term, both on the software, and in learning how to work together effectively. One member dropped out due to over-commitment, but most of the others pushed hard to get Version 0.6 out i time for me to <a href="http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=2231">take it to the Python Conference</a> in Atlanta, where we got a lot of useful feedback. We&#8217;re on track to do another release (Version 0.7) at the end of term or shortly after.</p>

<p>Things that are going well:</p>

<ol>
<li>Most students have found the find-code-review-commit rhythm that&#8217;s the programming equivalent of a marathon runner&#8217;s stride. As you can see from <a href="http://basieproject.org/svnstat/">our stats</a>, several team members are posting a few small patches every week, and everyone else is involved in checking them and discussing them.</li>
<li>Discussion: we have good attendance at the weekly online meetings, and there&#8217;s lots of back-and-forth in the mailing lists and IRC channel.</li>
<li>Code quality: remains high, thanks primarily to code reviews. (We could use more unit tests, but two team members are now wrestling with Selenium to accomplish exactly that.)</li>
<li>Self-awareness: putting my prof&#8217;s hat back on, this is the most important part of the course. I believe the students in the Basie team understand <em>why</em> to work this way, i.e., why they should create tickets for even the smallest tasks that they aren&#8217;t going to do immediately, why to review code before it&#8217;s committed, and so on.</li>
</ol>

<p>Things we need to improve:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some students are still struggling with the lack of hard deadlines in this course. Since their other assignments all have due dates, it&#8217;s easy to push work on Basie aside (&#8220;It&#8217;s not due tomorrow&#8221; == &#8220;I should be doing something else&#8221;). There&#8217;s not much time left for these students to catch up with their peers&#8230;</li>
<li>I need to do a better job of prioritization. On the one hand, I want students to work on fun stuff; on the other, someone has to deal with the mundane bug fixing, simplify the installation, etc., and I don&#8217;t always make it clear which is more important (because I haven&#8217;t thought it through carefully enough myself).</li>
</ol>

<p>Overall I&#8217;m very pleased: the difference between January 4 and today is remarkable.</p>
