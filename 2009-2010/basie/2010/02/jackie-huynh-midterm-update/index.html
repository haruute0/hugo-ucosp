  <p>Wow, it&#8217;s already half way through the term. Working with Greg and the Basie team has been a great experience. I am glad that I chose Basie as the project to work with, as I got to learn Django and Python. I feel that I&#8217;m working at a pretty good pace with Basie, but sometimes I feel that I&#8217;m not doing enough when compared to the more experienced members on the team. In the next half of the term, I will try and set better goals for myself, and strive to achieve them.</p>

<p>Additionally, during the next half of the term, I would like to learn more on web development in general, and JQuery. This is my first time working with JQuery (and Django) and I&#8217;m surprised how well JQuery works. It was pretty simple to pick up JQuery, but I feel that there is still a lot to learn. Also, I feel that my team has some very experienced members and that I could really benefit from working with them.</p>

<p>During the first half of the term, we&#8217;ve been bashing away at bugs and getting Basie 0.6 released. This coming half, I&#8217;m really looking forward to improving Basie by adding new features. Now that I&#8217;ve gone over most of the learning curve of Django, Python, and JQuery, I hope I can achieve more than before.</p>
