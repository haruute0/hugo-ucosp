<p><em>&#8220;Do not waste time being jealous: sometimes you&#8217;re ahead, sometimes behind. Race is long and in the end you see that you are only competing with yourself&#8221;.</em></p>

<p>__</p>

<p><strong>T</strong>he reason I switched from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science after my first undergrad year, to be short: it was extremely boring. I did not want to wait for the 3<sup>rd</sup> year to come in order¬† for the stuff to get more interesting. From the first two ‚Äúproject‚Äù courses in my undergrad I learnt zilch.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>n CS program things were slightly better: some of the faculty members understood the importance of having a balance between theory, and, well, ‚Äúcool stuff‚Äù. In our projects we imitated real software products, developed simple but very cool games (I still play my &#8220;warehouse wars&#8221; JavaScript game when I get bored of XBOX), learn how theory can be sometimes <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">cool</span> useful too.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>owever, one aspect was missing from my experience in all of my project / group CS courses: we were never taught to <em>make real decisions</em> about <em>our own</em> project<em>.</em> Surely, we were awarded better marks for cleaner code. But as an example, in my second year we weren&#8217;t allowed to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write your own socket writeln/readln methods in C. Rational: too complicated, you can&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;ll be hard for us [TA] to test it. Nobody cared that the provided methods were buggy üôÇ</li>
<li>Design your own plugin system for your game: too complicated, you won&#8217;t get it, it&#8217;ll be hard for us to mark it. Well, assignment&#8217;s implementation wasn&#8217;t good at all.</li>
<li>Come up with your own GUI: whaaat? are you insane? you have screenshots in your assignments üòõ</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>L</strong>ooks like a list of trivial tasks, but how much thinking, discussion, interaction can each single one of those promote? I&#8217;d never thought I&#8217;d have a chance to do those things at this university, but I am glad to know that I was wrong.</p>

<p><strong>N</strong>ot only UCOSP gave me a chance to meet my future colleagues in the field, but it also gave me a taste of what the real world responsibility is like. In short 2.5 days of the sprint I felt a lot of support both from the &#8220;old survivors&#8221; of the project and the new members like myself. I felt a healthy mix of responsibility and support.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong> think UofT should consider making this course mandatory for students in CS specialist/major programs. I am sure UofT <em>can</em> do that. If the don&#8217;t <em>want</em> to, here is my <em>why</em>: I can confidently say that this year I learnt and will learn more about human interaction, project management, responsibility, code practices than in my 4 years of undergrad at UofT. I think that&#8217;s worth something . It&#8217;d be definitely a better investment than a second reading week in December. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">I don&#8217;t read on vacations.</span></p>

<p><strong>Kudos to all organizers, mentors, TAs, and students for making UCOSP possible!</strong></p>

<p><strong>I</strong>f you read until here, you are a hero üôÇ</p>

<p><strong>Short summary of the work done during UCOSP &amp; plans:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I concentrated on the <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/">Tickets page</a> of Basie and on the <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/wiki/random-data-manpage-draft/">random-data</a> tool over these three days. I worked on &amp; closed: <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#95">95</a>, <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#90">90</a>, <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#82">82</a>, <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#73">73</a></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Started converting Alex into Linux faith.</span></li>
<li>I am planning to continue working on random-data, but I will give priority to the tickets assigned to me for <strong>0.6 Final</strong> (<a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#96">96</a>, <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#96">126</a>, <a href="http://basieproject.org/stable/basie/basie/tickets/#96">74</a>)</li>
