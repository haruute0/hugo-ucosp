<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reworked the patch for Bug 303426 to fix the problem Wayne noted.</li>
<li>I found the solution to Bug 303581 and included it in this patch as the code greatly overlapped and the problems were related. Made note of this in Bug 303581.</li>
<li>Started investigating into Bug 303420 (Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu) to see how this should be done. I have the main outline coded, but I&#8217;m still figuring out how to pull in the refactoring functionality to use in conjunction with this code.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-steps">Final Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Finish what I started this week on the class constructor (TODOs and Bug 301326: NewJavaClassConstructor#construct() needs to be more robust).</li>
<li>Look into Bug 303420: Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu.</li>
<li>Go back to Bug 299342: &ldquo;New Java Package&rdquo; option should automatically create a Java Project, to use the NewJavaProjectConstructor to create the default project.</li>
<li>Address Bug 303427: Can&#8217;t specify a source folder in the Package Wizard.</li>
<li>Complete final report.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="status-1">Status</h3>

<ul>
<li>Still quite busy with plenty of other schoolwork. Approaching end of term, and its always hectic.</li>
<li>Did get some time last weekend to do some more work on the drag and drop implementation. (See Bug 299878 for more info).</li>
<li>I ended up refactoring some code, and made the drag and drop listener implementations a little less &ldquo;exotic&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Will be following this update with a new patch to the bug.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Due to code halt within the next 2 weeks, I figure it might be best for me to keep working on the drag and drop implementation.</li>
<li>There is still a couple &ldquo;major&rdquo; issues to sort out, and I will try and fix those up. Namely, providing the ability to detect if a name conflict exists before attempting the move, and then provide the user the ability to change the file name.</li>
<li>Small stuff like &#8211; I have a good 6-8 TODOs to fix in the code, and I&#8217;m sure wayne will want to add his 2 cents in as well.</li>
<li>It would be nice if we got some feedback on all pending patches, so we can make sure they get finished / committed before the end of the course.</li>
<li>Complete final report.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="status-2">Status</h3>

<ul>
<li>Worked on simplifying the menus using the activities extension.</li>
<li>This seems to work quite well but complete control over the menus is still elusive.</li>
<li>There are a bunch of things I can remove and a few things that stubbornly wonâ€™t go away.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-steps-1">Final Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Figuring out how to simplify the menus. If this goes smoothly I will try to apply the lessons learned to simplifying the tool bars.</li>
<li>Complete final report.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roadblocks-2">Roadblocks</h3>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    Just difficulty figuring out how to get complete control over the UI.
  </li>
