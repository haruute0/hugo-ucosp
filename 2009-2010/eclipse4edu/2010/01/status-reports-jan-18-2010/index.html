<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<ul>
<li>Attended the Code Sprint</li>
<li>Spent a lot of time looking through the code, getting an idea for the framework.</li>
<li>Reported several bugs for the Java Lite perspective.</li>
<li>Tested the patch for Bug 244645 (making a new class in an empty workspace). I agree with it and also posted a new bug (299342) with a patch that does the equivalent for making a new package. However, after the code sprint, we decided that packages should be done away with overall (that is, hidden).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>Submitting a bug for hiding the concept of packages from the student, and working on it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roadblocks">Roadblocks</h3>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    None

<h3 id="status-1">Status</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Not much work done before code sprint &#8211; mainly attempting to setup environment, and emailed out some first impressions of the current state of the program.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Code sprint:</p>

<p>&#8211; Attempted to apply as many patches as possible, and test how they work.</p>

<p>&#8211; Used both scheme and java lite for some basic coding &#8211; attempted to use a &ldquo;1st year / 1st time coding&rdquo; perspective while using the eclipse plugins.</p>

<p>&#8211; Also looked into some competing plugins &#8211; namely pneumbra and how that tied into the eclipse framework.</p>

<p>&#8211; Added a bunch of new bugs to bugzilla (8 or so) that I noticed with scheme and the java lite views.</p>

<p>&#8211; Did a fair bit of work trying to learn the framework.</p>

<p>&#8211; Added a patch to <a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=288854">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=288854</a> to address about half the warnings (includes all of the arraylist ones though).</p>

<p>&#8211; Also posted some additional comments wrt. that bug / patch.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next-steps-1">Next Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>To put it bluntly, the eclipse UI needs a lot of work to be beginner programmer friendly. I&#8217;m going to try and work on reducing UI clutter, unneeded UI elements (including menus, toolbars, context menus, etc) for the java lite perspective.</li>
<li>I think customizing the RCP app will take us a step in this direction.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roadblocks-1">Roadblocks</h3>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    The Repository. Having to constantly update the project set seems to be a hassle&#8230; Are there any of important files that we may need / should be aware of before getting into the thick of development?
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="status-2">Status</h3>

<ul>
<li>On the weekend I mainly worked on figuring out how to simplify the menus. We made some progress by creating a perspective listener and removing all of the action sets from it.</li>
<li>I managed to learn enough to actually fix a bug. When a project is created automagically on class creation in an empty workspace, src and bin folders were created. I found out how to turn this switch off so that the src and bin folders are not created.</li>
<li>I figured out that when you create a patch you need to make sure you don’t have any other patches installed for other unrelated bugs so your patch doesn’t incorporate those changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next-steps-2">Next Steps</h3>

<ul>
<li>I would like to work on the menu and toolbar simplification but Cory has claimed that. I’ll let him work on that and chip in later if he needs help.</li>
<li>I think I am going to take a look at one of 2 things:

<ul>
<li>A Java Lite debugging perspective that illuminates concepts like scope, static space, the stack and the heap</li>
<li>The templates for class creation to distinguish between “programs” (classes with main methods) and “classes” (object oriented programming units)
<br />
<br />
<br /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="roadblocks-2">Roadblocks</h3>

<ul type="disc">
  <li>
    There are some menu items and tool bar items that do not appear to be ActionSets. I can’t figure out what they are and how to get rid of them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out how to get access to the debugging information and how to create and modify a Java Lite Debug perspective.
  </li>
</ul>
