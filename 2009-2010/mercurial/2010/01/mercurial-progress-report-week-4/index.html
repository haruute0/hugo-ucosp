  <p>We have made substantial progress towards getting our initial contributions ready for submitting to the mercurial-devel mailing list. This has been a week of testing and code reviews where we all learned something new about Mercurial and writing python code in general.</p>

<p>To summarize, you can expect the following extensions to be submitted to the mercurial mailing list in the next week:</p>

<ul>
<li>tagmerge (wendyY): support smart merging of tag files (tags are labels for specific commits or heads)

<ul>
<li>some fixes and testing, testing, testing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>cedit (paulitex): command line and interactive editing of mercurial configuration files with shortcuts for common setup operations

<ul>
<li>submitted iniparse (external lib) changes upstream</li>
<li>documentation, bootstrapping, testing, testing, testing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>convert (Tessa): modifying the convert extension to support wildcards in exclude statements

<ul>
<li>order/precedence of include vs. exclude</li>
</ul></li>
<li>cache-annotations (antmar): cache the results of the annotate (blame) command to speed up generation of annotations at future revisions.

<ul>
<li>case-insensitive cache store</li>
<li>code reviews</li>
</ul></li>
<li>caseguard (alexandru): warn/prevent users from committing files which cause problems on case-insensitive systems

<ul>
<li>code reviews</li>
<li>finishing up support for guarding specific commands</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>We posted our detailed progress reports on the <a href="https://ucosp.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W12" title="January 28 progress reports">January 28&#8217;th wiki page</a> before this week&#8217;s meeting.</p>

<p>As we discussed last week, our next project is to improve support for binary files in Mercurial.</p>

<ul>
<li>Binary files (or large text files) are often replaced with completely new versions during a commit. As a result they don&#8217;t compress well using deltas, and we end up storing many copies of the file, taking up space in each copy of the repository.</li>
<li>One solution is to store the files in a centralized store (local or remote) which is shared by many copies of the repository.</li>
<li>This solution is currently implemented as the &#8216;bfiles&#8217; extension by Greg Ward. It provides commands for dealing with b-files that mirror standard Mercurial commands (ex. &#8216;hg bfstatus&#8217; vs. &#8216;hg status&#8217;).</li>
<li>We plan to integrate bfiles with existing mercurial commands, add full support for HTTP-based stores, and other improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone has had a chance to read about and play with bfiles over the past week. The Waterloo people (Tessa, wendyY, and I) have decided to tackle integration with existing Mercurial commands.</p>
