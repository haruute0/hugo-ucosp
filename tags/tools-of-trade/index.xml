      <description>[I sent this post to the mailing list last week. Greg suggested I re-post it here, where it would last longer than on the mailing list.]
In his discussion of &amp;#8220;yak-shaving&amp;#8221;, Greg wrote:Â &amp;#8220;you very quickly lose sight of your original goal and wind up investing way too much time in things that aren&amp;#8217;t directly delivering value.&amp;#8221;
True, but bear in mind that the whole notion of &amp;#8220;investment&amp;#8221; is spending resources on something that does not directly deliver present value, with the expectation of future value.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a list of tools I cast essential for carrying out my day-to-day business or I find otherwise useful.
Hardware (in no particular order)**
**
 My primary workstation is a HP Pavillion Slimline, a pretty much standard, off-the-shelf PC on which I installed Ubuntu Linux. The hardware works reasonable well under Linux, but at some point I wish hardware vendors would just offer some models which work seamlessly with any major OS.</description>
