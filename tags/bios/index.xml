      <description>Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Anthony McCallum. I&amp;#8217;m in my final year of a computer science degree at the University of British Columbia. My language of choice is JAVA, but I also have experience with a variety of other languages. I will be working on the Ingres project this coming term. This will be my first opportunity to work on an open source project, and I am excited for the challenge! I&amp;#8217;ve previously done internships with RIM in Ottawa as well as a bioninformatics lab in Singapore.</description>

      <description>Here is a &amp;#8216;hello&amp;#8217; from Eva Wong for all the UCOSP buddies! I will be working with Ingres under Andrew Ross for this coming fall.
I’m a fourth year computer science undergraduate student at University of Toronto, specializing in information system. I’m also doing a mathematics minor. For the previous summers in between school years, other than biking, I have been working on the GIS that I found with my team, Geokudo(2009), also I have completed a data visualization tool as a GSoC project(2008) for HackyStat.</description>
