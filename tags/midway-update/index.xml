      <description>The progress of the term is going well since the deliverables are completed on time and the IBM folks are satisfied with them. The most important feeling in this project is that, although we are physically in three different cities, two different time zones, we are able to keep up the communication and plans. Each of us are assigned with a task, complete it on time, and merge all of our work into one deliverable, and this cycle goes on, even though all of us are busy with other things at the same time.</description>

      <description>Expectations, Status &amp;amp; Progress
Coming into this UCOSP project course, my ultimate goal was to be able to utilize the human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) design knowledge that I’ve acquired from both school and work to enhance the usability of MarkUs. Through this experience, I’m hoping to solidify my understanding of various usability concepts and familiarize myself with more projects out there.
Up until now, I feel that I’m on track with the work that I’m doing with MarkUs.</description>

      <description>This is my second semester joining the UCOSP with Ingres. From the lessons that I have learnt last term, I have planned my schedule out at the start from reading off the requirements of this semester and so far I am sticking to it quite well. I have completed half of the required patches.
Not only I found myself matured in how to co-operate with people working oversea, but also in self-monitoring.</description>
