      <description>This is my second semester joining the UCOSP with Ingres. From the lessons that I have learnt last term, I have planned my schedule out at the start from reading off the requirements of this semester and so far I am sticking to it quite well. I have completed half of the required patches.
Not only I found myself matured in how to co-operate with people working oversea, but also in self-monitoring.</description>

      <description>The following tutorial video is done with GEOS 3.2.0, compiled in gcc 4.3 and g++ 4.3 depending on Xerces C headers and libraries 2.8, pam-devel, pax, jam, on a Debian server as a non root user.

      <description>Thumbs up: The code sprint where all students and participating parties gathering face to face provides a precious opportunity for them to know each other, especially on each others&amp;#8217; working style, which helped a lot during the course later on.
Thumbs down: Difference between schools&amp;#8217; expectation from students leads to a significant difference in students&amp;#8217; motivation. If the students are grouped into sub teams working on the same smaller project, we should weight more on continuous communication.</description>

      <description>Here is a &amp;#8216;hello&amp;#8217; from Eva Wong for all the UCOSP buddies! I will be working with Ingres under Andrew Ross for this coming fall.
I’m a fourth year computer science undergraduate student at University of Toronto, specializing in information system. I’m also doing a mathematics minor. For the previous summers in between school years, other than biking, I have been working on the GIS that I found with my team, Geokudo(2009), also I have completed a data visualization tool as a GSoC project(2008) for HackyStat.</description>
