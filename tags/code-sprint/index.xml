      <description>The UCOSP sprint this fall was held at the University of Toronto Department of Computer Science September 23 &amp;#8211; 25. Students and project mentors came together from across the country to meet their teams and start working on their projects. Some photos from the code sprint are included in the gallery below.

      <description>This weekend, over 50 students and project mentors gathered in Toronto for this semester&amp;#8217;s code sprint.

Why go through all the trouble and expense of bringing students together to a single physical location to work on their projects? Isn&amp;#8217;t the point of UCOSP to teach students to work in a distributed environment? Yes, but from experience, we&amp;#8217;ve found that when teams are able to meet even once, the odds of success are dramatically increased.</description>

      <description>The day before the sprint, I knew of nothing about what I should do and what I can do in this project. I woke up at 5 on Friday morning, took a taxi to the bus terminal, got onto Greyhound to Toronto, got lost on our way to Bahen Centre (we were on University and College, 5 minutes away from Bahen, lol) To my surprise, I arrived, and joined a team of people as lost as I was.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Greg, all the mentors/organisers and the nice people from IBM (especially Matthew) for everything they have done for us. They have obviously put lots of effort and their spare time into this and I think we should all give them a big round of aplause.
So.. the code sprint is now officially over.. and here is what I think..
What I liked:
 Having the chance to meet everyone before we actually start coding turns out to be extremely valuable.</description>
