      <description>The term started off with an earlier Code Sprint kickoff than last term and this definitely helped get things in motion much quicker and allowed us to address problems much earlier on which I found was most helpful this term as our team ran into a series of dependent environment setup issues that delayed a lot of the work. The goals and requirements of the project were fairly vague at first, but despite these early setbacks, I found that the team I am working with this term (compared to my last term with UCOSP) is a lot more self-driven and willing to communicate, ask questions, keep each other updated and help each other out.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Greg, all the mentors/organisers and the nice people from IBM (especially Matthew) for everything they have done for us. They have obviously put lots of effort and their spare time into this and I think we should all give them a big round of aplause.
So.. the code sprint is now officially over.. and here is what I think..
What I liked:
 Having the chance to meet everyone before we actually start coding turns out to be extremely valuable.</description>

      <description>What we did today:
 Assigned work to each team member, following the agile development style, we now have 10 small, measurable tickets here &amp;#8211; the goal of this sprint is to deliver 4 scenarios, and piloting graphical indicator for the next sprint. So we will have enough knowledge of the code in the team when the next sprint begins.  We have our first road blocker today &amp;#8211; the WMDServer does not work on either of our environments, whether it being Mac, Windows 7 or Windows Vista, and we have decided to work on the following items:</description>
