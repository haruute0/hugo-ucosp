      <description>First off, I just want to say it has been a pleasure working with everyone. I certainly learned a lot this term with respect to the project as well as working in a team environment. A few final blogs with respect to the generic plugin parser for the elmcity project are listed below and the latest versions of the code can be found in the code repository here:

I hope this is good start to recreating FuseCal!</description>

Status:
+documenting and testing remote.py, batch.py (this leaves us with no &amp;#8220;big&amp;#8221; modules untested, rotate.py and event.py can
be done quickly later on).
 timezone had to be revisited and changed a bit (timezone_source, timezone_dest), and together with other little things   we officially announced the new features to the community
Roadblocks:
&amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve been sick for the past couple of days, so things are moving a bit slower for me than usual.</description>
