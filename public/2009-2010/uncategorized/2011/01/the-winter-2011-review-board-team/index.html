  <p>The Review Board team is happy to welcome our new 2011 Winter UCOSP</p>

<p>students! We&#8217;re looking forward to another successful semester of</p>

<p>Review Board development. So, without further ado, I&#8217;d like to</p>

<p>introduce the Winter 2011 Review Board Team:</p>

<ul>
<li>Steve Sutcliffe</li>
<li>Kahlil Amlani</li>
<li>Mengyun Kong</li>
<li>Crystal Lok Koo</li>
<li>Teresa Hume</li>
<li>Mark Striemer</li>
</ul>

<p>So the UCOSP codesprint finished up last week, and a lot got</p>

<p>accomplished. Students arrived with a Review Board development</p>

<p>install all ready to go, so they were eager to grab some easy bugs and</p>

<p>dive into the code. Lots of questions and traffic flew across IRC (3</p>

<p>/ 4 of the project mentors were not at the sprint, but were idling in</p>

<p>an IRC chatroom answering questions). Our students also got familiar</p>

<p>with Review Board’s Git workflow, and learned how to submit patches.</p>

<p>And patches were submitted! At least one of those patches has already</p>

<p>been merged, and the rest are still under review.</p>

<p>The team also used the weekend to tentatively select what projects</p>

<p>they wanted to work on. The projects are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>A Post-Commit WebUI (Crystal, Mark)</strong></p>

<p>Review Board so far has been geared toward pre-commit review, where a</p>

<p>change is put up before it&#8217;s committed. Many users want to be able to</p>

<p>instead select a revision or set of files (it depends on the type of</p>

<p>repository) and put them up for review instead. We&#8217;d need a good UI</p>

<p>for doing this.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Search (Crystal)</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the full-blown search that searches all the fields and file</p>

<p>paths and reviews and such, we could have a simple &#8220;quick search&#8221; that</p>

<p>provides a search field (we&#8217;d use the one for the standard search)</p>

<p>and, while typing, drops down a list of possible matches. It would</p>

<p>search summaries, review request ID numbers, users, and review groups.</p>

<p>It&#8217;d be a much faster way of getting around the site at times. A lot</p>

<p>still would have to be figured out for this.</p>

<p><strong>Spell Checking within Source Code (Mengyun, Kahlil):</strong></p>

<p>When syntax highlighting is used for diffs, Review Board can know if</p>

<p>it&#8217;s looking at a comment or a string or whatever. We could run a</p>

<p>simple spell check on the words and mark ones that might be spelled</p>

<p>incorrectly. We&#8217;d probably also want some way of adding words to the</p>

<p>Review Board install&#8217;s dictionary, which means adding new API.</p>

<p><strong>Extension Development (Mark, Kahlil)</strong></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve been working on an extension framework for a while now. It&#8217;s</p>

<p>coming along, but additional work probably needs to be done. What</p>

<p>we&#8217;ve been doing in the past is having someone work on an extension</p>

<p>idea and making sure that our extension framework is set up to do it.</p>

<p><strong>Scalability Testing Tools (Steve)</strong></p>

<p>We could always use new ways to help test the product.</p>

<p>One thing that would be useful would be a script that could</p>

<p>auto-generate/populate a database with sample data. It should be</p>

<p>configurable to create a certain amount of review requests, reviews,</p>

<p>diffs, users, etc. I should be able to run it and tell it I want</p>

<p>100,000 review request, each with between 1 and 10 reviews, and 1 and</p>

<p>5 diffs, across 300 users, and get a database I can work with. It</p>

<p>would greatly help for scalability.</p>

<p><strong>Theme Support (Teresa)</strong></p>

<p>Make it easy to override the look and feel of the site. Admins should</p>

<p>be able to drop a set of template files, images, CSS files, etc. in a</p>

<p>directory and configure Review Board to use that. What exactly we want</p>

<p>would have to be discussed further. It&#8217;s easy to go overboard or do</p>

<p>too little on a task like this.</p>

<p>It was a very successful sprint, and we’re looking forward to an</p>

<p>equally successful semester!</p>
