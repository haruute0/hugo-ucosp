  <p>We&#8217;ve all met them, and from time to time, we&#8217;ve all <em>been</em> one of them&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Anna</em> knows more about every subject than everyone else on the team put together&#8212;at least, she thinks she does. No matter what you say, she&#8217;ll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows better. Annas are pretty easy to spot: if you keep track in team meetings of how often people interrupt one another, her score is usually higher than everyone else&#8217;s put together.</p>

<p><em>Bao</em> is a contrarian: no matter what anyone says, he&#8217;ll take the opposite side. This is healthy in small doses, but when Bao does it, there&#8217;s always another objection lurking behind the first half dozen.</p>

<p><em>Caitlin</em> has so little confidence in her own ability (despite her good grades) that she won&#8217;t make any decision, no matter how small, until she has checked with someone else. Everything has to be spelled out in detail for her so that there&#8217;s no possibility of her getting anything wrong.</p>

<p><em>Frank</em> believes that knowledge is power. He enjoys knowing things that other people don&#8217;t&#8212;or to be more accurate, he enjoys it when people know he knows things they don&#8217;t. Frank can actually make things work, but when asked how he did it, he&#8217;ll grin and say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sure you can figure it out.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Hediyeh</em> is quiet. Very quiet. She never speaks up in meetings, even when she knows that what other people are saying is wrong. She might contribute to the mailing list, but she&#8217;s very sensitive to criticism, and will always back down rather than defending her point of view. Hediyeh isn&#8217;t a troublemaker, but rather a lost opportunity.</p>

<p><em>Kenny</em> is a hitchhiker. He has discovered that most people would rather shoulder some extra work than snitch, and he takes advantage of it at every turn. The frustrating thing is that he&#8217;s so damn <em>plausible</em> when someone finally does confront him. &#8220;There have been mistakes on all sides,&#8221; he says, or, &#8220;Well, I think you&#8217;re nit-picking.&#8221; The only way to deal with Kenny is to stand up to him: remember, if he&#8217;s not doing his share, <em>he&#8217;s the bad guy</em>, not you.</p>

<p><em>Melissa</em> would easily have made the varsity procrastination team if she&#8217;d bothered to show up to tryouts. She means well&#8212;she really does feel bad about letting people down&#8212;but somehow something always comes up, and her tasks are never finished until the last possible moment. Of course, that means that everyone who is depending on her can&#8217;t do their work until <em>after</em> the last possible moment&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Petra</em>&#8216;s favorite phrase is &#8220;why don&#8217;t we&#8221;. Why don&#8217;t we write a GUI to help people edit the program&#8217;s configuration files? Hey, why don&#8217;t we invent our own little language for designing GUIs? Her energy and enthusiasm are hard to argue with, but argue you must. Otherwise, for every step you move forward, the project&#8217;s goalposts will recede by two. This is called feature creep, and has ruined many projects that might otherwise have delivered something small, but useful.</p>

<p><em>Raj</em> is rude. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the way I talk,&#8221; he says, &#8220;If you can&#8217;t hack it, maybe you should find another team.&#8221; His favorite phrase is, &#8220;That&#8217;s stupid,&#8221; and he uses obscenity as aggressively as characters in Tarantino films. His only redeeming grace is that he can&#8217;t dissemble in front of the instructor as well as Kenny, so he&#8217;s easier to get rid of.</p>

<p><em>Sergei</em> is simply incompetent. He doesn&#8217;t understand the problem, he hasn&#8217;t bothered to master the tools and libraries he&#8217;s supposed to be using, the code he checks in doesn&#8217;t compile, and his thirty-second bug fixes introduce more problems than they solve. If he means well, try to re-partition the work so that he&#8217;ll do less damage. If he doesn&#8217;t, he should be treated like any other hitchhiker.</p>
