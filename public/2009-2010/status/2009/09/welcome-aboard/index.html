  <p>We officially kick off next week (though a lot has already happened), so:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have not yet signed up for the Google Group we&#8217;re using for administrative matters, please do so. (Names of those who appear not to have signed up are at the bottom of this message.) If your spam filter ate the invite, please let me know and I&#8217;ll re-issue.</li>
<li>If you are a student, you should have received a welcoming message from your project lead with details about the project, how it&#8217;s going to be managed, etc. If you didn&#8217;t, please let me know and I&#8217;ll hook you up.</li>
<li>If you have not created an ID for yourself at wordpress.com, please do so, and send me the email address you gave them. (Believe it or not, I can&#8217;t look you up by ID, only by email.) I will then give you authoring privileges on the <a href="http://ucosp.wordpress.com">http://ucosp.wordpress.com</a> blog. This is *not* optional&#8212;you need to do some public writing as part of this course.</li>
<li>The first piece of public writing I want from you is a short biography (100-200 words long), which will be your first post on the UCOSP blog. I&#8217;ve attached mine as an example.</li>
<li>You&#8217;re all invited to come to Toronto Sept 25-27 to meet your teammates in person and sprint on your project. We will cover travel costs for Canadian students, and accommodation and meals for both Canadians and Americans. I&#8217;ll send details on a school-by-school basis, but please start looking for flights, trains, or buses that will get you here on the evening of Thursday, Sept 24, and take you home after 3:00 pm on Sunday, Sept 27. (Students from the Virgin Islands, you&#8217;ll be staying over Sunday night and flying back Monday morning&#8212;it&#8217;s the only thing that seems to work.)</li>
<li>Please coordinate with your project lead to find a one-hour slot for a weekly online meeting this term, and have your first meeting next week (Sept 7-12). Project leads, please let me know the slot you&#8217;ve picked; where possible, I&#8217;d like to sit in, or have one of the course TAs do so. Please also have one of the students take notes and post a summary of each meeting on the UCOSP blog (tagged with the name of your project). These minutes are also part of the grading for the course.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly, if you have questions or problems, please don&#8217;t be shy about getting in touch&#8212;we&#8217;re here to help.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Greg</p>
