  <p>Over the last four or five years, there&#8217;s been a dramatic increase in the number of books about programming: not the specifics of this language or that framework, but the act of programming itself. Fogel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007590"><em>Producing Open Source Software</em></a>, Spinellis&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201799405"><em>Code Reading</em></a>, Ford&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596519788"><em>The Productive Programmer</em></a>, Doar&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007965"><em>Practical Development Environments</em></a>, and multi-author collections like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596510047"><em>Beautiful Code</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596159811"><em>Beautiful Testing</em></a> all discuss the things that separate people who can write code that compiles and runs from people who can build useful software.</p>

<p>The most recent entry in this category is Seibel&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430219483"><em>Coders at Work</em></a>, which collects his interviews with 15 great programmers. I haven&#8217;t finished it yet, but two things keep jumping out at me. The first is the importance of getting things into users&#8217; hands as early as possible. It doesn&#8217;t have to be finished, and it certainly doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect; as long as it does something&#8212;anything&#8212;that they find useful, they&#8217;ll start giving you feedback. No matter how smart you are, you can only foresee a small fraction of what people will actually want to do, or how they&#8217;ll want to do it; letting them drive your software around is the best way to get the early course corrections that can save you days or weeks of wasted effort.</p>

<p>The second thing that jumps out at me is how focused these programmers are on avoiding waste&#8212;or rather, on delivering value. Will adding this feature or refactoring that module make the user&#8217;s life better in the near term? If not, file a ticket and move on, because there are plenty of other things that will. No, you shouldn&#8217;t let too much <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a> pile up, and yes, there are times when writing another abstraction layer will make development of the next dozen things so much faster that you&#8217;ll be ahead overall, but you have to know both your users and your code very well to be sure of that payoff. It&#8217;s all to easy to go from, &#8220;I want to fix this bug,&#8221; to, &#8220;Hm, I should refactor these classes first,&#8221; and then to, &#8220;Well, if I&#8217;m going to do that, I should upgrade this library,&#8221; and, &#8220;So first I&#8217;ll patch my OS,&#8221; until you find yourself three hours later saying, &#8220;OK, so once I&#8217;ve shaved the yak&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>So does this mean people should just hack together whatever works today with no thought for tomorrow? Of course not. Well-written code is its own reward, and one of your goals as a professional should be to make the right way of doing things a habit so that you won&#8217;t make silly mistakes when you&#8217;re tired, stressed, and up against a deadline. As an inveterate yak-shaver, I&#8217;ve found it helpful to always ask someone by email, &#8220;Should I be doing this?&#8221; <em>before</em> I start anything that&#8217;s going to take more than half an hour. At the very least, it keeps my teammates up to date with what I&#8217;m working on, and more often than you&#8217;d think, someone on the team will say, &#8220;Actually, wouldn&#8217;t it be more productive for you to do this other thing instead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I need to go milk a whale&#8230;</p>
