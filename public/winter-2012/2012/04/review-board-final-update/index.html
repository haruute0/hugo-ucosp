  <p>Wilson Yeung from Review Board writes:</p>

<p>Hi! I’m Wilson Yeung and I’m in my last semester at Simon Fraser University where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computing Science.  I joined the Review Board team because an opportunity was presented to  the computing undergrads at SFU to join UCOSP.  Despite having high expectations, I am still surprised at how fulfilling this experience is.  Being enclosed in a controlled learning environment at university, I was excited to work on something that had real life applications and meaning to the outside world.</p>

<p>I have grown quite a bit since I started working on Review Board.  Prior to Review Board, I rarely did anything on the command line, haven’t used a linux OS, half decent at Python and Java, and a beginner in some other generically known languages such as HTML and C.  (Yes, I was a noob) Throughout this term, all those things have changed.  With tons of hard work and the comfortable learning environment, I’ve improved lots.  Albeit I’m not a pro at everything, but I’m comfortable with running Ubuntu from the command line, and I’ve read a hundred-ish pages of documentation on Java, JavaScript, Django, HTML, and much more.  Not only did I learn through reading documentation this semester, but I was given invaluable experience from the mentors and team members of Review Board.</p>

<p>If you didn’t know, Review Board is a web-based tool to do code reviews.  Due to the nature of the purpose of  Review Board, it becomes an invaluable tool in any project.  It tracks changes while giving you a bunch of tools to give critique or approval.</p>

<p>Throughout the semester, I’ve committed most of my time reading documentation on different languages to work on a certain project.  That project involved creating a setting in a user’s profile that would reflect changes in the comment boxes generated when you want to comment on some code.  Although it doesn’t sound very complicated, the architecture of Review Board can make the problem quite complicated.  The project forced me go through every level of the architecture in Review Board as well as access the database on the server.  While taking into consideration not only python files, but also JavaScript files and HTML files, it was difficult to maneuver between different file types and languages.</p>

<p>To conclude,  the Review Board team is awesome.  I wish there were more powerful words to explain how great the team is.  Everyone is intelligent, hard-working, and has a good sense of humour.  I would like to thank the UCOSP steering committee and the SFU liaison professor, Dr. Ted Kirkpatrick for making this possible for me.  Extra kudos to our mentors; Mike Conley, Christian Hammond,  and David Trowbridge, for being all-knowing, yet chose to guide us rather than spoon-feed us.  None of this would be possible without their time and their commitment to UCOSP.  I would highly recommend any comp sci undergrad to apply for UCOSP (ESPECIALLY Review Board) if they want to get a running start on their career in the computing science field.</p>
