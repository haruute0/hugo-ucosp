  Ellen Ko&#8217;s post on the Google Summer of Code blog is good advice for students doing cross-country projects as well: making contact with your project lead early, and staying in contact regularly during the term, greatly improves your chances of success. Gopal Kapur&#8217;s advice on how to report status is worth reading too: the more direct you are, the more quickly your project lead and teammates can help you.

  <p>
  The idea of running cross-country projects was inspired by the work of many other people. Looking at what they&#8217;ve done might help students and faculty understand what we&#8217;re likely to accomplish, and why we&#8217;re doing things the way we are. First up is Google Summer of Code, &#8220;&#8230;a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects.&#8221; 2500 students have done GSoC since its inception in 2005; each student is matched with an existing open source project and a mentor, and works full-time for 12 weeks on something specific.

  A big hello to the Computer Science departments at Minnesota State University and the University of the Virgin Islands, where Prof. Steven Case is now trying to recruit a few students to join us for the fall. Two weeks &#8217;til we launch&#8212;we have a lot of organizing to do, but it&#8217;s going to be fun.

  One of the most interesting parts of this course for me is watching students decide what projects to work on. When answering their questions, I frequently find myself quoting something that Wayne Gretzky once said when asked what made him such a great player: &#8220;A good hockey player goes where the puck is. A great hockey player goes where the puck is going to be.&#8221; Five years ago, when Napster was making headlines, students typically wanted to write peer-to-peer filesharing tools; today, many of them want to do Ruby on Rails, social networking, or iPhone development.

  Our final project(s) for the Fall 2009 term are now on the web. There&#8217;s an &#8220;s&#8221; in parentheses because it&#8217;ll be up to the students to decide which of the two we&#8217;ll take on. One involves working with geospatial (map) data; the other is to extend Django&#8216;s object/relational mapping layer (the goo that stuffs objects into database tables and restores them as necessary) to work with the Ingres database. Both will give students a chance to work with some very cool technologies; I look forward to seeing who picks them up.

  Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors, we are going to bring all of the students taking part in these projects together in Toronto Sept 25-27 for a three-day code sprint. This will give teams a chance to get to know each other in person, and to firm up their goals for the term. I&#8217;ll post more details about travel and accommodation arrangements as we have them.

  The previous post touched on the need for more emphasis on evidence-based results in software engineering. This is a rapidly growing area of research&#8212;many of the papers at this year&#8217;s International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE&#8217;09) presented, included, or referenced experiments or field studies of one kind or another. Alongside this, there is growing interest in software engineering as a human activity, which has led many researchers to look at fields like social psychology.

  Following up the theme of the previous post on habits, this article discusses ten habits developers have to break in order to be successful with Scrum) (a popular agile development methodology). A lot of the author&#8217;s points are good ones, but others are straw men set up just to be knocked over. For example, &#8220;Traditional project management is very stubborn about setting the project plan and sticking to it no matter what,&#8221; is a caricature of engineering-style project management.
