  Hi, I&#8217;m Philip Patchin, one of the TAs for the Robocup project. I&#8217;m a new MSc student at the University of Toronto, where I also did my bachelor&#8217;s degree. My undergrad included a specialist in artificial intelligence and a major in linguistics, but I am now working in the systems area. I have a significant number of years of industry experience &#8211; and the grey hairs to prove it! I was involved with the initial CSC49x Robocup course as a volunteer, and I look forward to continuing with the project.

  Hi, I&#8217;m Owen Matthews and will be working on the WikiDev project. I&#8217;m a 4th year undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I have a variety of interests and experience, but with no particular focus yet. I have had 5 co-op terms at 3 different Canadian companies, and just completed an 11 month co-op term in Osaka, Japan. I&#8217;m looking forward to working with the WikiDev team and meeting everyone in Toronto.

  Hi! I am Severin Gehwolf, a second/third year Computer Science student at University of Toronto. Before coming to Toronto &#8211; starting my second degree &#8211; I was working for almost 2 years. It was then when I realized what interests me most: Software and its very internals. I got involved with MarkUs and Ruby on Rails during winter term 2009, but really didn&#8217;t do any Rails development until this summer when I started to work on MarkUs full-time.

  Hi All! My name is Melanie Gaudet and I am going to work on MarkUs project this fall. I have started my journey with computers by a 3 years study in computer science(CEGEP). I have been hired in a great company, first as Progress database’s administrator, and then as programmer-analyst and finally as project leader. The programming language I have been using the most so far is Progress, but I have tried many others so even though I have never worked with Rubby, I know that I will learn.

  How should a group of people find a time for a meeting? If they all work for the same organization, their availability might already be in a shared system like Outlook (though that&#8217;s by no means guaranteed). Ten years ago, Jon Udell pointed out that online tools were a good lightweight solution to this problem. The MarkUs team is already using WhenIsGood to figure out when they can get together; if your project hasn&#8217;t already picked a meeting time, maybe you&#8217;d like to give it a try too.

  Hi guys, my name is Nikita (to forestall any questions &#8211; yes that&#8217;s a male name in some countries, including Russia! :]) Pchelin and this semester I will be working on the ElmCity project. I am a 3rd year CS and French student, at the University of Toronto (Mississauga campus). I am really excited about taking this course – partly because if the programming challenges, but also because I want to experience working in a large team.

  Mount St. Helens, WA Hi, my name is Tara Clark and I&#8217;m going to be working on the MarkUs project this fall. I am a 4th year Computer Science and French student at the University of Waterloo. I love web programming and learning new languages (both natural and programming!) I first started out with web programming about 6 years ago and this will be my first time working with Ruby on Rails.

  Hi, my name is Jory Graham, and I&#8217;m looking forward to working with some of you on the elmcity project. I&#8217;m an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, just finishing up my last few courses. I&#8217;m primarily interested in natural language processing (which I plan on continuing to study), and calendar data is no exception. My underlying interests are the subconcious patterns that we all abide by without realizing. After seeing Jon&#8217;s presentation at Science 2.0, I became very excited in the prospects inherent in elmcity.

  Over on the Google Open Source blog, Robert Konigsberg has posted about Google&#8217;s recent Eclipse Day. And there are videos! I might wish that Eclipse had a smaller memory footprint or simpler APIs, but there&#8217;s no arguing with the vibrancy and passion of its developers and user community.

  Earlier today I used our Google Group to ask students for information for the very first time. Of the first dozen who replied, half mailed me back directly; the other half just hit &#8220;reply&#8221;, and wouldn&#8217;t you know it, Google Groups sets message headers to send replies to the whole list by default. Oops. So, without further ado, here&#8217;s my first apology of the term&#8212;I should have checked what the default setting was, then changed it.
