  the good: Working with a good team. We&#8217;ve all had those projects where half the team is asleep or incapable of communicating or just doesn&#8217;t do their work. This was one of those rare group projects where I got to be in a group of students who *wanted* to be there. it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m more used to in the free software world but not in school. the bad: The chaos. Having our team drop to 5 people threw off a lot of the plans we&#8217;d made at the sprint.

  I have really enjoyed working on MarkUs this semester! One of the things I liked the best was that our TA and one of the students on our team had both already worked on our project before and they knew both MarkUs and Ruby on Rails inside and out. I think that everyone on the team benefited from their past experiences and it was great to be able to get advice from them and ask them questions throughout the semester.

  I think that this course was a great way to finish off my undergraduate computer science career. I am working on the MarkUs project. One of the things that I really like about MarkUs is that we have students working on developing a system that students will use to submit assignments. I really wish that we could use a similar methodology to develop a new course registration system (similar to the functionality that PeopleSoft&#8217;s QUEST currently provides for us) and an online course system (similar to ANGEL or WebCT).

  Overall I really enjoyed this course. The one bad thing is that a lot was opened ended. This can be a good thing, however I things like have 2 deliverable dates throughout the semester so we know what we have to accomplish by these dates. Also, making code reviews a requirement and having to turn in a list of goals to accomplish by the end of the code sprint instead of half way through the semester.

  I guess since everyone else started with the goods and finished with the bads. I&#8217;ll go in reverse, leave a better taste in your mouth. I definitely disliked the fact that I was the only one not in the Eastern time zone, it made it hard for us to get together(virtually). I also found it difficult to chat with the team. By the time I was finished my classes, it was already way late in the Eastern area.

  Up : The great start we had during the code sprint. Wayne Beaton and Dwight Deugo took their time to travel to Toronto and to explain us some really useful concepts and tools. Without them, the team would have started later. Down : The lack of review from our supervisors. I know that they have a lot to do and that they can&#8217;t hold our hands, but it would have been nice to know if our last submit was good/ok/bad and the reason why they think so.

  Thumbs up: I think code reviews really helped keep everyone on track and to maintain high standards. Mike did a great job reading and commenting on the reviews. It turned out to be a good form of communication between meetings. Thumbs not so up: As a supervisor, I just couldn&#8217;t keep up, so it was hard to help steer the progress. Thumbs down: This is a hard format for a postmortem.

  <p>
  ThumbUp: Having meetings every week and posting status reports helped keep us on track. ThumbDown: I think it would be good to have more variety in projects, in particular some that are less development-oriented and involve more research

  <p>
  ThumbUp: peer reviews. Peer reviews, at least for the Basie team, was certainly a new type of experience in software development. It promoted communication between the team, getting into each other&#8217;s code, writing code that is good enough for others to look at, and then still getting feedback on how to improve it. It creates a better &#8220;team&#8221; feeling, than simply having a group of people commit to the same source code repository.

  <p>
  Thumbs up: The code sprint where all students and participating parties gathering face to face provides a precious opportunity for them to know each other, especially on each others&#8217; working style, which helped a lot during the course later on. Thumbs down: Difference between schools&#8217; expectation from students leads to a significant difference in students&#8217; motivation. If the students are grouped into sub teams working on the same smaller project, we should weight more on continuous communication.
