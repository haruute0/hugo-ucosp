  Karin Ng from the University of Toronto gives us her experience working with UMPLE this term. Umple merges UML modeling and programming to facilitate Model-Oriented Programming. The models include class diagrams, state machines, and composite structures. My primary project is to create a generator that takes in current Umple semantics to produce GraphViz (open source graph visualization software) code of an entity-relationship diagram. After I have completed the generation, I hope to look into refactoring all the generators and extracting commonalities into a generation library.

  Andrew Hong from the University of Toronto gives us his impressions of the program. It has been almost two full months in the Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects (UCOSP) program and now that I look back, it has been an amazing experience. If you are reading this, you probably have an idea of what the UCOSP program is about and are looking to find out more. UCOSP is basically where you get to work on a distributed open source project for a semester with a team of students and mentors.

  Yifan Ren from the University of Waterloo provides this overview of his UCOSP experience: I Participated in the BB10 PhoneGap team and was working on porting native plugins for BlackBerry10. I had an enjoyable and rewarding time working on the project, and experienced real-world software engineering practices and open source collaboration. One thing I really appreciate about the BB10 PhoneGap project is its tasks. It has a list of independent tasks, and each one requests to build a complete plugin project of a useful feature, for example, zip file extraction and compression, barcode scanner, and system dialog.

  Faraz Sherwani from the University of Waterloo shares his thoughts on the UCOSP program this term. Why you may want to UCOSP Meet, work with and be mentored by some really smart people in your field. Learn a new language, or set of tools that a particular project uses, but that you are not too familiar or experienced with. Learn the details of a particular source control workflow that you may not have used in the past.

  Yanjia Xin from the University of Waterloo summarizes her UCOSP experience: I have grown quite a bit since I started working on Review Board. Prior to Review Board, I rarely did anything on web development, touched a little bit HTML and Javascript. I was a beginner in python, and never actually seen any Django projects before. Throughout this term, all those things have changed. Here are some tips I would like to share with all of you.

  Peter from UofT checks in: ReviewBoard is a web service which facilitates code review amongst developers within a repository (Git, SVN, etc). The project I am working on is an implementation of TogetherJS, an extension (or plugin) that organizations can choose to install within their instance of ReviewBoard. TogetherJS is a javascript library that allows multiple users to discuss a webpage through text and voice chat and live cursor interaction. A demo is available here.

  Olessia Karpova from the University of Toronto summarizes her UCOSP experience: First steps The first step after being accepted into the program is picking the project. This year there were over 20 projects, how do you choose the right one? This is something you’ll be working on for a considerable amount of time – think about what your priorities are: is it to dive deeper into a topic you are already comfortable with?

  Wen-Chien Chen from Waterloo fills us in on his work with MediaWiki extensions: MediaWiki is a versatile wiki software package written in PHP that powers websites where users write collaboratively. It is used in a variety of applications, from Wikipedia to the online documentation of Arch Linux. The extension architecture of MediaWiki allows it to adapt to the needs of different applications: while the core portion of the software is already powerful, it can be augmented with modular extensions.

  James Wood from Waterloo is working on Blackberry Cordova plugins on Linux and provides this reference for future developers who are trying to do the same. History As of this writing, Linux is not supported by Blackberry for development, which means if you are reading this, that you have chosen to walk the difficult path. The good news is that you won&#8217;t be alone, and hopefully this guide will help get you started.
