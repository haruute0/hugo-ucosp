  There is a great description of the steps students took to getting fully up to speed and moving forward on their projects on the Review Board blog. I&#8217;m glad to hear that the code sprint was worthwhile!

  Hi everyone, Just a quick status update from the EOL team here: we have met each other at last at the fantastic UCOSP code sprint in Toronto! At the code sprint, we learned a lot of things. Our awesome mentors Dmitry and Lisa started off by teaching us how to use Git and instructing us on the proper commit workflow for the EOL project hosted on Github. We then spent the remainder of the code sprint setting up our development environments.

  Lots of things are happening behind the scenes as we gear up for UCOSP again this fall. Faculty across Canada are recruiting students, we are busy trying to collect a few more projects and finalize the ones we have tentatively arranged, and we are still looking for more sponsors. We are very grateful to Google for agreeing to be our major sponsor for the second year in a row. We are also grateful for the enthusiastic support of the CACS/AIC (the association of Canadain computer science chairs).

  Now that we have reached the middle of the term it is a great time for a blog post in order to see where we stand.&nbsp; Since the beginning of the term, we got all introduced to the POSIT app and got familiar with it&#8217;s components and architecture. In order to warm up, each of us started to look into some re-factoring and testing tasks. We identified few issues that were worth tackling but were also minor enough such that we could accomplish them in a short amount of time.

  It&#8217;s been a while since the code sprint and everyone is settling down nicely. Apart from other courses, there haven&#8217;t been any major road blocks the MarkUs team has faced. Everyone is using the resources they can to breeze through the problems with their various issues. Thanks to our amazing mentors, many of us have overcome the problems we&#8217;ve encountered so far. The IRC channel provides a perfect place for efficient question and answer sprints while the mentors try to help everyone who&#8217;s stuck.

  We are now well underway in our ReviewBoard projects, though, like everyone, its a challenge to balance both UCOSP and the rest of our courses/lives/commitments. In addition, for some of us it seems our progress is pretty slow for the moment as we are still trying to learn the languages &amp; digging down to see all the nit &amp; grit of ReviewBoard! I&#8217;m currently working on the scalability testing for ReviewBoard &amp; its quite an interesting process to say the least.

  From Feb 3rd to Feb 17th, we continued to work on implementing some of the core features of CoRAL, including searching, uploading and claiming publications, changing user profile settings. Except searching, only logged in user has access to these features. Most of our work is on the user&#8217;s profile page, and we have made a lot of changes to both the user interface and functionality. In settings tab, user can change his/her information to be private or public, or modify some personal information, including password.

  At the amazing code sprint, we became familiar with our teammates, git and Reviewboard and now after the kick-off, we begin to dive into Reviewboard. It is first step that costs troublesome, especially when there are quite a lot of new stuffs (e.g. python, django, git, Reviewboard, etc ) Sometimes we don’t know where to go and sometimes we mess up the code. Fortunately, there are people we know we can turn to for help—our mentors!

  Hi All! We are just beginning our tasks for our project &#8211; FreeSeeR, an open-source video capture tool customized for academic and industrial conferences! After receiving our assignment to the project, we met traveled to Edmonton to meet each other: Alex Perelygin, 4th year Math &amp; Computer Science (joint major) Simon Fraser University Dan Palmer, 4th year Computer Science Laurentian University Maggie Yu, Math &amp; Computer Science University of British Columbia Fei Wang, Computer Science Lethbridge University John Mavity, Computer Science Laurentian University Our mentor Andrew Ross was unable to attend, but we were able to work together through Skype and instant messaging, which let us begin our distributed-teamwork early:) The weekend was a great success in introducing team-mates to each other and teams to each other, making our future (distributed) teamwork much easier; our group personally had much effort invested in learning the project management process of our project (design specifications, project roadmap, scheduling etc.) and in the technical foundation for our project (configuring virtual machines to run varying flavors of Linux, installing and configuring requisite software libraries for the FreeSeeR project, etc.).
