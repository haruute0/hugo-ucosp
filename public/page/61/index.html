  Mike Conley Hi, I&#8217;m Mike Conley, and I&#8217;m one of the TA&#8217;s for this course. I will be helping Karen Reid manage the MarkUs Project this semester. I&#8217;m a Masters student at the University of Toronto in the Software Engineering group, and I just finished my undergrad at UofT, doubling in Computer Science and Dramatic Arts. I&#8217;ve been working on MarkUs since September, 2008. I&#8217;ve been web programming in one form or another for over a decade, but MarkUs has been my first time working on a fairly sophisticated Ruby on Rails project.

  We officially kick off next week (though a lot has already happened), so: If you have not yet signed up for the Google Group we&#8217;re using for administrative matters, please do so. (Names of those who appear not to have signed up are at the bottom of this message.) If your spam filter ate the invite, please let me know and I&#8217;ll re-issue. If you are a student, you should have received a welcoming message from your project lead with details about the project, how it&#8217;s going to be managed, etc.

  How do you manage development when two or more people (or teams) are making major incompatible changes at the same time? The answer is to create branches in your version control repository, but that can go sour in many ways. If you&#8217;d like some advice on how to do it right, check out: &#8220;High-Level Best Practices in Software Configuration Management&#8221; from the folks who make Perforce (which is still my favorite version control system).

  Adam Goucher taught me most of what I know about quality assurance. He&#8217;s now in charge of the same at Zerofootprint, as well as a regular speaker at agile and testing conferences, and has kindly agreed to give the MarkUs team some guidance this fall. (Basie and Thunderbird teams take note: much of what he says applies to you too.) His thirty-second guide is a good place to start; I look forward to hearing more from him.

  We&#8217;re very pleased to welcome our first students from Carleton University in Ottawa, and Memorial University in Newfoundland&#8212;and not just because this means we&#8217;ll have students this term who can dabble their toes in three different oceans :-). Ah, if only there was a university that bordered the Arctic Ocean&#8230; This brings the total number of students to 46, which is nearly double our original target of two dozen. The budget for bringing them together Sept 25-27 won&#8217;t stretch much further, so we&#8217;re going to close the door on enrolment for the fall in just a few days.

  Over on the MarkUs blog, Karen Reid has posted an introduction to the team for the fall, and promised to outline projects the students might take on. Meanwhile, Bill Konrad has posted some project ideas for Basie, and I&#8217;ll follow up with an introduction to the team later this week. We should have all our students in place by the end of this week; things will start moving pretty quickly once Labor Day has come and gone.

  I spoke yesterday with Jon Udell about goals for ElmCity for this fall. He has since posted two very cool things: Using FriendFeed to manage a loosely-coupled team. Pulling project members&#8217; own blog postings, Facebook status updates, tweets, and the like together in one place is probably as cost-effective a way to manage a team as the usual mailing list + IRC channel. A lengthy description of how to make elmcity and WordPress play nicely together.

  More good news: Minnesota State and the University of the Virgin Islands are putting in two students each, and we&#8217;ve had one more from Michigan State sign up (project yet to be determined). That means that Basie, ElmCity, MarkUs, RoboCup, and WikiDev are fully staffed for the fall; we just need to fill in the Eclipse4Edu, Ingres, and Thunderbird teams and we&#8217;ll be ready to go (for some value of &#8220;ready&#8221;, of course ðŸ™‚ ).

  <p>
  Jason Cohen of SmartBear recently posted an article about &#8220;survivor bias&#8220;. His basic message is that you have to look at failures as well as successes in order to get a fair picture of what works and what doesn&#8217;t. By some estimates, 95% or more of the projects on open source portals like SourceForge and Google Code are inactive; looking at why they didn&#8217;t pan out is at least as informative as looking at the few that did.

  This post titled &#8220;Signs that you&#8217;re a bad programmer&#8221; isn&#8217;t backed up by any empirical studies, but it still rings true. What do you think the author missed? What do you look for when deciding whether someone can or can&#8217;t build usable software with reasonable effort?
