  Brenda Status Submitted a patch to Bug 301326 to handle the possibility of multiple source folders when creating a new class using the constructor. Reported Bug 306651 and submitted a patch for it that creates a package constructor like those for projects and classes, including tests. It also includes a rework of the Package Creation Wizard to use the constructor, along the lines of the project and class wizards. Final Steps Look into Bug 303420: Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu.

  Victoria Status Brainstormed ideas for the Dashboard. Went through draft Dashboard contents with Karen and Farah and got some good and constructive feedback Next Steps With the feedback I got back regarding the potential Dashboard contents, come up with a preliminary prototype &#8212; one that we can take apart and help establish a better idea as to how we&#8217;d like to design the Dashboard. Roadblocks Swamped with work (from my full-time position).

  We had a brief meeting today and here is the summary. Present: Brenda, Cory Absent: Miles Drag and Drop &#8211; Cory is still plugging away at implementing this, as it is not a small task. If anyone is interested in looking at it and providing feedback, it would be beneficial. &#8211; He is also wondering if anyone has priorities or features in mind in regards to drag and drop. Class Wizard &#8211; Brenda intends to refactor her patch for fixing the package dropdown menu to separate UI from the model.

  Guillaume Simard and François Fournier are writing Selenium tests for Basie. Over on the Basie blog, they explain why they&#8217;re using random data in their tests, rather than testing against predefined fixtures. What is your group using? And why?

  Brenda Status Reworked the patch for Bug 303426 to fix the problem Wayne noted. I found the solution to Bug 303581 and included it in this patch as the code greatly overlapped and the problems were related. Made note of this in Bug 303581. Started investigating into Bug 303420 (Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu) to see how this should be done. I have the main outline coded, but I&#8217;m still figuring out how to pull in the refactoring functionality to use in conjunction with this code.
