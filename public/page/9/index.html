  The CoRAL team (formerly known as fab4) has been making great progress on our task. The task is to develop a visualization service for the fab4 browser project, whose objective is to support communities of readers by allowing them to share their comments on the documents they read. The original fab4 project simply provides a canvas on which to place and view annotations of different types on a document. In our work, we assume that the fab4 user community consists of researchers either reviewing papers for the purpose of writing surveys and related-research sections of new publications or for the purpose of accepting/rejecting papers submitted to a conference.

  <p>
  This weekend, over 50 students and project mentors gathered in Toronto for this semester&#8217;s code sprint. Why go through all the trouble and expense of bringing students together to a single physical location to work on their projects? Isn&#8217;t the point of UCOSP to teach students to work in a distributed environment? Yes, but from experience, we&#8217;ve found that when teams are able to meet even once, the odds of success are dramatically increased.

  OSCON? What&#8217;s OSCON? A keynote talk at OSCON OSCON brings together people like you from across the open source universe to learn, inspire each other, and collaborate. If our mission is to get students working on cool open source projects, what better place to look for mentors? In addition, we were interested in how other people are teaching open source software in academia. Luckily, OSCON had lots of people with something to say on the topic.

  UCOSP, the distributed undergraduate capstone course, is preparing for another year and we need your help! Forgot what UCOSP is? Here&#8217;s a refresher. Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects brings together students from coast to coast to work together on joint capstone projects. Students learn first-hand what distributed development is like. Each team has students from two or three schools, and uses a mix of agile and open source processes under the supervision of a faculty or industry lead.

  Almost all of this term&#8217;s students have sent in their self-evaluations, and their evaluations of their mentors. Overall, people seem to have enjoyed working on things that are actually going to be used, and getting to know their peers and their industry mentors. There are a few things we need to do better next time&#8212;clearer goals for some projects, some grades midway through term so that people know where they stand, etc.&#8212;but I think we all deserve an &#8216;A&#8217; for what we accomplished.

  Our FlightSim project has come to a close last week, after posting our final delieverable. It&#8217;s been a long ride, so I thought I should take my time to write down my experience and what I&#8217;ve learned here. Different from most of you, our project started at IBM&#8217;s lab, not at the St. George campus. On our first morning, all of us were invited to their lab at Markham. The lab itself is a really cool place, and the IBMers have treated us well.

  This week is another productive week for Thunderbird Team in that most of us have finished most of their work! Wei Xian has resolved his bug (restore session) and his patch has been pushed to comm-central. Also, he is going to prepare a &#8220;quick start guide&#8221; for future students who are going to work on Thunderbird. For myself, I have posted my revised patch and get the review from Blake. Now I have submitted a secondary review request and hopefully everything is going all right.

  Today marks the last day of classes at the University of Waterloo, and so ends the official portion of the UCOSP project for Tessa, Wendy, and myself. During our last meeting on April 1st, we tied some loose ends on our patches and discussed our experiences in the project. I will save the details for the final reports, but we all agreed that we&#8217;d like to continue contributing to Mercurial as time permits.
