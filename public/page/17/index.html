  My first degree is in engineering, and while I&#8217;m too clumsy to have ever actually practiced [1], the courses I took still shape the way I look at things. In particular, I still enjoy articles like this one,which reports parse and load times for Javascript on various platforms. I really wish that a course on systems performance was a standard part of every undergrad CS degree; I doubt that&#8217;ll happen any time soon, but this stuff is out there if you look for it.

  Wow, it&#8217;s already half way through the term. Working with Greg and the Basie team has been a great experience. I am glad that I chose Basie as the project to work with, as I got to learn Django and Python. I feel that I&#8217;m working at a pretty good pace with Basie, but sometimes I feel that I&#8217;m not doing enough when compared to the more experienced members on the team.

  When we set out at the beginning of UCOSP, my goal was for us to contribute significantly to Mercurial by the end of the semester. How well have we accomplished that goal so far? At the beginning of the semester, all of the students were given small, self-contained bug fixes and features that we&#8217;d discovered people wanted over the course of developing Kiln, mostly in the form of Mercurial extensions. Four of these were quickly completed: cedit, a command-line-based way to configure Mercurial; cache-annotations, which makes annotating files repeatedly ridiculously fast; globexclude, which allows you to exclude files based on their glob pattern when doing conversions to Mercurial; and caseguard, which warns you when you are committing files that have names that will prevent Mac and Windows users from using your repository.

  Eclipse4Edu has gone fairly well. I feel like I am pretty much on track. I&#8217;ve been trying to put in one day a week towards this project and I&#8217;ve pretty much managed to do that. I think my major goals for this semester are to get the new Java class wizards and classes in good shape and get a good handle on simplifying the menus and toolbars by the end of the semester.

  Two months have passed since I joined Markus in Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Project (UCOSP). I thought it was just another course, but it&#8217;s a completely different than every other one I&#8217;ve ever taken. The most noticeable difference is that no instructor is around! In a regular course, I am told how to do stuffs. I sit in a comfortable chair in the classroom, follow the instructions given by teachers and do best I to meet their expectation.

  We had a brief meeting today; here is what we discussed. Present: Miles, Cory and Brenda Absent: No one Naming &#8211; Educlipse (or EduEclipse) is short, concise and demonstrates what it is – a version of Eclipse meant for education. &#8211; Eclipse IDE for Education fits well with the naming schemes for other Eclipse products. &#8211; The consensus between us still seems to be Educlipse or EduEclipse, however. Templates &#8211; Discussed opening an extension point for the templates; we shouldn’t need more than 2-4 templates ourselves.

  Hi everyone, this is my midway update. Well.. technically this is my midway update. However, since I&#8217;m a student at Université Laval we started our semester slightly later than the rest of Canada and it&#8217;s going to be over by the end of April. I plan on working on Basie until the end of my term so that means that I still have more time in front of me to get things done.

  Brenda Status Looked further into the use of plugin_customization.ini for setting the default perspective and it seems this file is created when we compile a standalone RCP App. Cory posted details on its use in Bug 299869. Submitted bug reports 303425, 303426 and 303427, related to the Class and Package wizards. Submitted a patch that alters my previous patch for hiding packages and source folders so that all source folders are hidden, not just those named &ldquo;src&rdquo; Looked into the other issue Wayne found with this patch (project explorer view not always updating), but haven&#8217;t come to a solution yet.

  warm-up I&#8217;ve used open-source software for the last 7 years (which is feels like a blip in Internet time). I was aware since the beginning that these projects thrive on contributions from people all over the world. And I knew that these tools had bugs and had roadmaps with desired features waiting on some developer to tackle. But before UCOSP I&#8217;ve never made a solid contribution to anything. I always imagined expert programmers are the only ones that have a business getting involved in these projects and submitting patches and extensions.

  The first half of the semester has flown by quickly. Like last semester, I&#8217;m really enjoying being a part of the MarkUs team! It was nice to already have my development environment from last semester all set and ready to go for this semester. Since I didn&#8217;t have to spend any time on setup, I was able to jump back into the code right away. I&#8217;ve found that things make a lot more sense to me now than they did around the same time last semester.
