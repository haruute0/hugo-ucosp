  I&#8217;m pretty happy with both my progress so far and the progress of our entire team (Mercurial). As Anton and Tessa have mentioned, we hit a bit of a slow period recently with bfiles but I think that&#8217;s natural. We had an exceptionally productive first month and a bit (largely thanks to the code sprint!). Every person on our team contributed non-trivial extensions that tangibly increased the usability of Mercurial. I think that is something we should be very proud of.

  I&#8217;m definitely feeling better about working on projects with _huge_ codebases like Thunderbird. I&#8217;m currently working on a patch to add a &#8220;Reopen last tab&#8221; button to Thunderbird. I&#8217;m finally feeling like I know my way around Thunderbird&#8217;s tab management code. I submitted a patch a couple weeks ago and got some feedback, and I&#8217;ve done most of what the patch suggested. The only thing left to do before I submit my patch again is to figure out why the UI tests sometimes pass and sometimes fail on my computer (even without my patch applied!) After I get that figured out, I need to write a few more UI tests.

  This semester has not been as productive as I would have liked. I set out to fix a single bug in Thunderbird that I thought would be cool to do. Before I left code sprint I found I had to fix another bug first to add support to fix the original. Doing so would put my code in the base Mozilla library, which was used for Firefox also, so I thought this was exceptionally cool.

  Working on Basie has been a great learning experience. There are always plenty of things to work on and learn from. The people are also great, I feel privileged to be able to work with a group of students who are so hard working and care so much about the project. Like any project the ramp up time is the most painful. I feel that the ramp up time for Basie has been longer than I had hoped.

  Simply put, I&#8217;m dissatisfied with my performance with MarkUs. Up until now, I&#8217;ve been doing what could be considered the bare minimum of work to get a passing &#8220;grade&#8221; for UCOSP. This is my final school term which means I&#8217;m looking to the future a lot this term, searching for full time employment. While I&#8217;ve been very successful in this endeavour to tell the truth, it does mean that certain trade offs have been made which have not been to MarkUs&#8217; benefit.

  So far, Eclipse4Edu has been a very useful experience for me. It’s the first project I’ve worked on where the codebase wasn’t written entirely by myself or by my team of 2-3 students. This has definitely been difficult, but like I said, useful. That combined with the complex framework and abstraction of Eclipse has made tasks that seem relatively trivial suddenly much more time-consuming. I’ve spent a fair amount of time simply looking through the code to familiarize myself with how things were implemented by others that have worked on the project.

  In General, I feel that I started the term out well, but I am presently falling behind my expectations, the “midterm slump” as Benjamin calls it. Within the first few weeks of the term had I submitted my bug fix to the Mercurial mailing list. I hoped that each week I would have completed some tangible amount of coding, whether it be implementing a small bit of functionality or fixing a bug in last week’s work.

  We are half-way through the term and I am enjoying working on Basie a lot. I think in our team we didn&#8217;t have much time to play around and get used to the project because 0.6 was planned soon. This gave a very energetic push in the beginning of the year, and 0.7 is something that pushes me to try my best and do work in time now, when 0.6 is out.

  It&#8217;s hard to believe that we are already 1&frasl;2 way through the UCOSP Mercurial project. It has been an amazing learning experience from both a technical and a social point of view. I started out this project with some limited experience of using Mercurial on my own system. Not only did I have to learn Mercurial in the context of a team, but I also had to put myself in the shoes of users very different from myself.

  A former boss of mine had a sign on the wall in his office that said, &#8220;Out there, right now, someone is writing a queue and getting it wrong.&#8221; What he meant was that if you&#8217;re using a mature language like Java or Python, you should never have to deal with textbook data structures, dates and times, currencies, and other things directly: someone else will always have been there first. So, if you find yourself wrestling with timezones or passwords, fire up your favorite search engine and see what it turns up.
