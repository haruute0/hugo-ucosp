  Brenda Status Submitted a patch for Bug 299965 so that projects made outside the Lite perspective will also hide packages (and the source folder). Explored and discussed other possibilities with respect to this bug (hiding all packages versus select ones, and making beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of Java Lite which determine whether or not packages are shown). Next Steps Try another angle for Bug 299965 based on Wayne&#8217;s comments in the conference call and on the bug page.

  I posted a link last week to Evan Robinson&#8217;s article explaining why crunch mode doesn&#8217;t work. Coincidentally, Ruben Ortega&#8217;s latest post on the ACM site asks, Why Do Software Developers Tolerate &#8220;Crunch Time&#8221;? His answer is &#8220;progress&#8221;, or at least, developers&#8217; need to feel like they&#8217;re making progress. A couple of paragraphs later, though, he says: It is unrealistic to deliver any project without going through some &#8220;Crunch time.&#8221; I personally think that is the root of the problem.

  We&#8217;ve all met them, and from time to time, we&#8217;ve all been one of them&#8230; Anna knows more about every subject than everyone else on the team put together&#8212;at least, she thinks she does. No matter what you say, she&#8217;ll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows better. Annas are pretty easy to spot: if you keep track in team meetings of how often people interrupt one another, her score is usually higher than everyone else&#8217;s put together.

  For the full update, check out our project blog. Everyone is starting to feel the pressure of their classes this semester, but despite this several of us are close to submitting our first patch. A common theme is difficulty understanding how to work with the Mozilla platform, but learning how to work with someone else&#8217;s code is good experience for us all.

  After our conference call today, here&#8217;s a summary of the current situation of what I&#8217;ve been working on, as well as the direction this aspect of the project is going: The past couple weeks, I&#8217;ve been working on hiding references to packages (in the project explorer, as well as buttons and menus that allow the user to create a new package). The concept that is being discussed is that we don&#8217;t want the user to work in Java Lite for the first month or so of their course, then come to the point where they switch to the regular Java perspective and become overwhelmed by the sudden presence of many tools they have not been introduced to.

  We have made substantial progress towards getting our initial contributions ready for submitting to the mercurial-devel mailing list. This has been a week of testing and code reviews where we all learned something new about Mercurial and writing python code in general. To summarize, you can expect the following extensions to be submitted to the mercurial mailing list in the next week: tagmerge (wendyY): support smart merging of tag files (tags are labels for specific commits or heads) some fixes and testing, testing, testing cedit (paulitex): command line and interactive editing of mercurial configuration files with shortcuts for common setup operations submitted iniparse (external lib) changes upstream documentation, bootstrapping, testing, testing, testing convert (Tessa): modifying the convert extension to support wildcards in exclude statements order/precedence of include vs.
