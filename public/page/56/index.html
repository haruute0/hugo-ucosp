  Who owns open source software? The simple answer is &#8220;everyone&#8221;, but the reality is more complex. Take a look at these two documents: http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/committers-agreement.pdf http://www.canonical.com/contributors In order to protect people who want to make contributions, many open source projects set up non-profit organizations. If you want to make a contribution, you have to agree to give that organization the right to use your code. That doesn&#8217;t mean you lose your rights (read the second paragraph of the Canonical agreement, for example), but it does stop you from turning around next year and saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to start a company around this, so I&#8217;d like you to take it out of your packages.&#8221; We haven&#8217;t needed agreements like this for code written by summer interns: they&#8217;re doing the work for hire, and we&#8217;re their employer.

  My name is Botlhale Ntsimane. I come from Botswana and have previously done part I of the Bachelor of Science program at University of Botswana which mostly covered Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science courses. I am now taking a Computer Engineering degree at University of Victoria with a Software specialization. My study at University of Victoria involves a mandatory cooperative program. Through the cooperative program, I have occupied Software Development (4 months) and Quality Assurance (12 months) roles.

  Hello, my name is Dana McDougal and I am currently a senior majoring in computer science at the University of the Virgin Islands. I am a member of a prestige organization in U.V.I. called the Emerging Caribbean Scientists. The ECS consists of multiple programs that focus on increasing research training for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics students. While attending U.V.I., I got an opportunity to participate in a summer research experience with the RISE program.

  Hi, my name is Elias Adum. I am currently in 3rd year Computer Science Software Engineering program at the University of Toronto and I will be working on the Ingres project. I started coding when I was in high school. Since then I developed a strong interest in web applications. I’ve worked with several Microsoft technologies but now I would like to change focus and do some open source programming, just to try a bit of both.

  Ted Tate Hi, I&#8217;m Ted Tate and I will be working on the (Count?) Basie project. I&#8217;m a fourth year Computing Science student at SFU focusing on programming languages and software engineering. In the past I have worked as a C++ developer including a co-op position at Safe Software working in the spatial data domain. I&#8217;m excited to begin work on the Basie project so I can jump headfirst into the buzzword-laden zoo of web programming.

  An ex-student of mine is trying to decide what web technology to use in the project he&#8217;s about to start working on. The three choices are Java plus some kind of framework, Django and Python (which he knows very well), or Ruby on Rails (which he doesn&#8217;t, but could pick up quickly). The argument in favor of Java plus whatever is that his employer is sure to be able to hire good Java programmers at a reasonable price for the next decade, but as he points out, doing small or medium-sized project in Java takes longer and hurts more than doing it in a dynamic language like Python or Ruby.

  There are a number of tools available, both open-source and commercial which get lumped into the bucket of &#8216;functional testing tools&#8217;. Essentially they help you, well, test the functionality of your application. One of these tools for testing web-based applications is Selenium. Selenium has at its core three different components: a record/playback tool (Se-IDE), language bindings (Se-RC) and a distributed execution framework (Se-Grid). I put up a post on my blog called The Selenium Value Chain which briefly discusses each and the progression between them.

  Hi, I&#8217;m Brent Mombourquette. I&#8217;m in my third year studying computer science at University of Toronto. I&#8217;m aiming for a specialist in Artificial Intelligence, although so far I haven&#8217;t taken any AI related courses. During this fall I&#8217;ll be working on the RoboCup Soccer project. I spent this past summer working with Professor Steve Easterbrook, developing a Firefox plug-in to aid climate scientists in researching. It was a great experience, although I was working by myself.
