      <description>&lt;p&gt;First Patch Ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once my pending patch has been checked into the source tree, I will become a member of the open source community. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look like much but it does fix a problem. I take heart from Richard Feynman who said, &amp;#8221; No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&amp;#8221;.Â  Here is a few things I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Svn needs a better way to manage patches because pending ones causes a mess. To keep from mangling my patch, I ended up having to checkout another copy to code with. If anyone has a better solution please tell me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stand on other people&amp;#8217;s shoulders. We borrowed a custom test runner to integrate the nose test framework into django during the code sprint (Thanks Jeff!). Then we discovered that he maintains a version of it on github so now we point to the source and save ourselves maintence/installation issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People on IRC are really nice. I needed help with my patch so I hopped on IRC (mozilla/education). It was nice to have someone who knew a lot about coding and ISPDB (David Ascher) take the time to thoroughly discuss the issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
