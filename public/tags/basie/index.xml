      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ThumbUp: &lt;em&gt;peer reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Peer reviews, at least for the Basie team, was certainly a new type of experience in software development. It promoted communication between the team, getting into each other&amp;#8217;s code, writing code that is good enough for others to look at, and then still getting feedback on how to improve it. It creates a better &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;team&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; feeling, than simply having a group of people commit to the same source code repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ThumbDown: &lt;em&gt;peer reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. As good as they were, peer reviews also left a lot more to be desired. It is certainly a different experience now, than at the beginning of the term when most new members on the project were intimidated to both comment on other people&amp;#8217;s code or even have their code be looked at by someone else. I think in the future, it might be a good idea to force the students to break some comfort zones sooner. I would have also liked to see more back&amp;amp;forth &lt;em&gt;discussion&lt;/em&gt; of design/performance considerations, rather than one-sided comments on the use of language&amp;#8217;s style guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
