      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the UCOSP term starts to wind down Mike DeLong (UGuelph) and Alex Kwan (SFU) have managed to land their contribution for the term. Details about their experience building the Webworks &lt;a href=&#34;http://devblog.blackberry.com/2013/04/blackberry-10-webworks-barcode-scanner-by-ucosp-students/&#34;&gt;barcode scanning extension&lt;/a&gt; are online.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UMPLE&amp;#8217;s first post of Winter 2013</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the first blog post from Umple, written by Geoffrey Guest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying has never been a joy of mine, however, we made it here in one piece&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so I guess I can&amp;#8217;t really complain. I met up with another UCOSPer, purely&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by coincedence, on the way down. It turns out we both fit the bill of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;computer science student&amp;#8221; in our own imaginations. The weekend was already&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;shaping up to be an excellent social and academic experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday was the day of errors. Yet through them we marched, never getting so&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;stuck as to quit all together and eventually we all came to the same place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group was a little discouraged by what they thought were fatal errors,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but in reality they could continue programming with them. In any case, it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;was a relief to get on the shuttle and go back to the hotel where we shared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in some alcoholic beverages and had a few laughes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday on the other hand was the day of progress. Having overcome most of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the hang up&amp;#8217;s the group started working on issues in full. I had completed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;some patches prior to the code sprint, so I had some experience, and was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;delighted to find that my aquired knowledge about the project would now be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;useful to the others. There were several commits made, one that broke the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;build but it was definitely progress. And in general everyone was in better&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;spirits. Me and another team member went to the Hobbit which was just as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;good the second time as the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I think the team has made tremendous strides in terms of being able&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to talk to one another when we have problems, as well as becoming more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;familiar with the code. Both of these were facilitated quite well by our&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mentor who was always very encouraging. We must learn to wade into the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;code, before we can swim in it, and we must do this slowly because or else&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we will be swept away by the current and be lost. I think we have all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;learnt a great deal hear at the hackfest, and I&amp;#8217;m sure that we will learn a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;great deal more by the end of the semester. In the end I think that joining&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this program is going to be one of the best decisions I&amp;#8217;ve made for my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;life, and it&amp;#8217;s fun too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This term&amp;#8217;s code sprint was held at Facebook Headquarters in California. Holding the sprint outside of Canada was a first for UCOSP, but it enabled us to join up with 110 students from several US and International schools that were also holding a similar weekend hackfest on the Facebook campus. This term 43 students from 19 Canadian universities are working on 7 different projects. Photos to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
