  The fall projects are now available. We are happy to welcome back six projects from recent years. These include two projects that have been with us since the beginning or nearly the beginning of UCOSP: Reviewboard and Umple. We are welcoming back Julian and the Formulize project as well as three projects from Mozilla: Firefox development tools, Code Coverage, and Task Cluster. Our new projects include another Firefox Development Tools project on the React debugger, and two new projects with a more analytic focus.

  Preparations for the next term are well underway. We are finalizing projects with our project mentors, including some exciting potential new projects. We haven&rsquo;t updated the project list yet, so stay tuned. The code sprint will be at the Mozilla offices in downtown Toronto Sept 22-24. Students will be getting email shortly to start booking flights.

  The open source communities have no shortage of generous people! We have nine projects ready to go and 28 wonderful mentors to work with students. I&rsquo;d like to welcome back returning mentors from Reviewboard, MarkUs, Umple, Mylyn, and Firefox Code Coverage. I&rsquo;d especially like to welcome Greg Mierzwinski who is returning as a mentor for Firefox Code Coverage after working on it as a UCOSP student. We have four new projects from Mozilla: Firefox 3D Z-index Tool, TaskCluster-Pulse, Pontoon, and FlyWeb.

  Planning is in full swing for the fall term. Students and faculty are definitely thinking about September. Looking at our registration form we already have about half the number of students we expect signed up and more are starting to roll in. Our fall code sprint will be held at the Mozilla offices in downtown Toronto. Their community space is a great place to work, and Mike Hoye and his team are excellent hosts.

  Year in Review We had another great year with UCOSP, thanks to the generous sponsorship from Google and the support of the CACS/AIC. Thirty-five students attended the September code sprint in Vancouver at the beautiful UBC campus. Our wonderful long term project mentors once again created a great experience for our students. We welcomed back ReviewBoard, Formulize, BB 10/Phonegap, MarkUs, and Umple. We were thrilled to welcome back Dethe Elza with Waterbear, and Jim Parry with CodeIgniter.

  &ndash; Adam Wong Hey everyone, now that I am halfway through my UCOSP project, I would like to take some time to reflect and share some of my experiences. I have had the honor of working with three other talented students from the University of British Columbia as well as with two friendly and intelligent Mozilla employees in the Jupyter Notebook project. So what exactly is a Jupyter Notebook, and why should you really care?

  <p>
  (An experience report from Yorie Nakayama) If you are developing with python on Django, or on any frameworks that employ the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm, you might come across whether there is a way to easily visualize all the models and their dependency relationships in your application as a diagram. Models are central to most applications using MVC, and being able to glance at the structure of models and their relationships to each other greatly helps any developer beginning to hack on the codebase.

  As we prepare for the next group of students who will start in January, we are seeing some turnover in the project offerings for UCOSP, so I&#8217;d like to welcome the newcomers and thank the project mentors from the past term. The project mentors for Waterbear, CodeIgniter, and Mylyn are all based in Vancouver which makes it more difficult to attend a code sprint in Toronto. It has been great working with Dethe, James and Sam, and I hope we will have a chance to work with you again in the future!

  Xing Zeng from UToronto who has been working on the CodeIgniter project checks in on this term. I am working on the CodeIgniter Project. More specifically, our team is spending most of our time in developing Netbeans plugin for CodeIgniter developers. CodeIgniter is a light-weight PHP framework, loosely based on the popular Model-View-Controller development pattern. It is the 4th most widely-used PHP framework throughout the Internet[1]. Despite this, there has been no IDE plugin for it on any major IDE, where lots of other PHP frameworks, including the famous Symphony and the not so famous Nette2, all have IDE plugins specifically designed to work with the features of their library.
