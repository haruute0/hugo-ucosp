  <p>Here is the first blog post from Umple, written by Geoffrey Guest.</p>

<p>Flying has never been a joy of mine, however, we made it here in one piece</p>

<p>so I guess I can&#8217;t really complain. I met up with another UCOSPer, purely</p>

<p>by coincedence, on the way down. It turns out we both fit the bill of</p>

<p>&#8220;computer science student&#8221; in our own imaginations. The weekend was already</p>

<p>shaping up to be an excellent social and academic experience.</p>

<p>Friday was the day of errors. Yet through them we marched, never getting so</p>

<p>stuck as to quit all together and eventually we all came to the same place.</p>

<p>The group was a little discouraged by what they thought were fatal errors,</p>

<p>but in reality they could continue programming with them. In any case, it</p>

<p>was a relief to get on the shuttle and go back to the hotel where we shared</p>

<p>in some alcoholic beverages and had a few laughes.</p>

<p>Saturday on the other hand was the day of progress. Having overcome most of</p>

<p>the hang up&#8217;s the group started working on issues in full. I had completed</p>

<p>some patches prior to the code sprint, so I had some experience, and was</p>

<p>delighted to find that my aquired knowledge about the project would now be</p>

<p>useful to the others. There were several commits made, one that broke the</p>

<p>build but it was definitely progress. And in general everyone was in better</p>

<p>spirits. Me and another team member went to the Hobbit which was just as</p>

<p>good the second time as the first.</p>

<p>Overall I think the team has made tremendous strides in terms of being able</p>

<p>to talk to one another when we have problems, as well as becoming more</p>

<p>familiar with the code. Both of these were facilitated quite well by our</p>

<p>mentor who was always very encouraging. We must learn to wade into the</p>

<p>code, before we can swim in it, and we must do this slowly because or else</p>

<p>we will be swept away by the current and be lost. I think we have all</p>

<p>learnt a great deal hear at the hackfest, and I&#8217;m sure that we will learn a</p>

<p>great deal more by the end of the semester. In the end I think that joining</p>

<p>this program is going to be one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve made for my</p>

<p>life, and it&#8217;s fun too.</p>
