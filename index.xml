      <description>The fall projects are now available. We are happy to welcome back six projects from recent years. These include two projects that have been with us since the beginning or nearly the beginning of UCOSP: Reviewboard and Umple. We are welcoming back Julian and the Formulize project as well as three projects from Mozilla: Firefox development tools, Code Coverage, and Task Cluster.
Our new projects include another Firefox Development Tools project on the React debugger, and two new projects with a more analytic focus.</description>

      <description>The open source communities have no shortage of generous people! We have nine projects ready to go and 28 wonderful mentors to work with students. I&amp;rsquo;d like to welcome back returning mentors from Reviewboard, MarkUs, Umple, Mylyn, and Firefox Code Coverage. I&amp;rsquo;d especially like to welcome Greg Mierzwinski who is returning as a mentor for Firefox Code Coverage after working on it as a UCOSP student.
We have four new projects from Mozilla: Firefox 3D Z-index Tool, TaskCluster-Pulse, Pontoon, and FlyWeb.</description>

      <description>Planning is in full swing for the fall term. Students and faculty are definitely thinking about September. Looking at our registration form we already have about half the number of students we expect signed up and more are starting to roll in.
Our fall code sprint will be held at the Mozilla offices in downtown Toronto. Their community space is a great place to work, and Mike Hoye and his team are excellent hosts.</description>

      <description>Year in Review We had another great year with UCOSP, thanks to the generous sponsorship from Google and the support of the CACS/AIC.
Thirty-five students attended the September code sprint in Vancouver at the beautiful UBC campus. Our wonderful long term project mentors once again created a great experience for our students. We welcomed back ReviewBoard, Formulize, BB 10/Phonegap, MarkUs, and Umple.
We were thrilled to welcome back Dethe Elza with Waterbear, and Jim Parry with CodeIgniter.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; Adam Wong
Hey everyone, now that I am halfway through my UCOSP project, I would like to take some time to reflect and share some of my experiences. I have had the honor of working with three other talented students from the University of British Columbia as well as with two friendly and intelligent Mozilla employees in the Jupyter Notebook project.
So what exactly is a Jupyter Notebook, and why should you really care?</description>

      <description>(An experience report from Yorie Nakayama)
If you are developing with python on Django, or on any frameworks that employ the MVC (Model-View-Controller) paradigm, you might come across whether there is a way to easily visualize all the models and their dependency relationships in your application as a diagram. Models are central to most applications using MVC, and being able to glance at the structure of models and their relationships to each other greatly helps any developer beginning to hack on the codebase.</description>

      <description>As we prepare for the next group of students who will start in January, we are seeing some turnover in the project offerings for UCOSP, so I&amp;#8217;d like to welcome the newcomers and thank the project mentors from the past term.
The project mentors for Waterbear, CodeIgniter, and Mylyn are all based in Vancouver which makes it more difficult to attend a code sprint in Toronto. It has been great working with Dethe, James and Sam, and I hope we will have a chance to work with you again in the future!</description>

      <description>Xing Zeng from UToronto who has been working on the CodeIgniter project checks in on this term. I am working on the CodeIgniter Project. More specifically, our team is spending most of our time in developing Netbeans plugin for CodeIgniter developers.
CodeIgniter is a light-weight PHP framework, loosely based on the popular Model-View-Controller development pattern. It is the 4th most widely-used PHP framework throughout the Internet[1]. Despite this, there has been no IDE plugin for it on any major IDE, where lots of other PHP frameworks, including the famous Symphony and the not so famous Nette2, all have IDE plugins specifically designed to work with the features of their library.</description>

      <description>Karin Ng from the University of Toronto gives us her experience working with UMPLE this term.
Umple merges UML modeling and programming to facilitate Model-Oriented Programming. The models include class diagrams, state machines, and composite structures. My primary project is to create a generator that takes in current Umple semantics to produce GraphViz (open source graph visualization software) code of an entity-relationship diagram. After I have completed the generation, I hope to look into refactoring all the generators and extracting commonalities into a generation library.</description>

      <description>Andrew Hong from the University of Toronto gives us his impressions of the program.  It has been almost two full months in the Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects (UCOSP) program and now that I look back, it has been an amazing experience. If you are reading this, you probably have an idea of what the UCOSP program is about and are looking to find out more. UCOSP is basically where you get to work on a distributed open source project for a semester with a team of students and mentors.</description>

      <description>Yifan Ren from the University of Waterloo provides this overview of his UCOSP experience: I Participated in the BB10 PhoneGap team and was working on porting native plugins for BlackBerry10. I had an enjoyable and rewarding time working on the project, and experienced real-world software engineering practices and open source collaboration.
One thing I really appreciate about the BB10 PhoneGap project is its tasks. It has a list of independent tasks, and each one requests to build a complete plugin project of a useful feature, for example, zip file extraction and compression, barcode scanner, and system dialog.</description>

      <description>Faraz Sherwani from the University of Waterloo shares his thoughts on the UCOSP program this term.  Why you may want to UCOSP     Meet, work with and be mentored by some really smart people in your field.   Learn a new language, or set of tools that a particular project uses, but that you are not too familiar or experienced with.   Learn the details of a particular source control workflow that you may not have used in the past.</description>

      <description>Yanjia Xin from the University of Waterloo summarizes her UCOSP experience:
I have grown quite a bit since I started working on Review Board. Prior to Review Board, I rarely did anything on web development, touched a little bit HTML and Javascript. I was a beginner in python, and never actually seen any Django projects before. Throughout this term, all those things have changed. Here are some tips I would like to share with all of you.</description>

      <description>Peter from UofT checks in:
ReviewBoard is a web service which facilitates code review amongst developers
within a repository (Git, SVN, etc). The project I am working on is an
implementation of TogetherJS, an extension (or plugin) that organizations can
choose to install within their instance of ReviewBoard. TogetherJS is a
javascript library that allows multiple users to discuss a webpage through
text and voice chat and live cursor interaction. A demo is available here.</description>

      <description>Olessia Karpova from the University of Toronto summarizes her UCOSP experience:
First steps
The first step after being accepted into the program is picking the project. This year there were over 20 projects, how do you choose the right one? This is something you’ll be working on for a considerable amount of time – think about what your priorities are: is it to dive deeper into a topic you are already comfortable with?</description>

      <description>Wen-Chien Chen from Waterloo fills us in on his work with MediaWiki extensions:
MediaWiki is a versatile wiki software package written in PHP that powers websites where users write collaboratively. It is used in a variety of applications, from Wikipedia to the online documentation of Arch Linux. The extension architecture of MediaWiki allows it to adapt to the needs of different applications: while the core portion of the software is already powerful, it can be augmented with modular extensions.</description>

History As of this writing, Linux is not supported by Blackberry for development, which means if you are reading this, that you have chosen to walk the difficult path. The good news is that you won&amp;#8217;t be alone, and hopefully this guide will help get you started.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Brandon Noad, and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. This term I was selected to participate in the UCOSP program where I get to work on an open source software project with other students from around the globe—for credit! The project I was assigned to is called GeoTrellis. GeoTrellis is a Scala library and framework for creating useful, high performing web services that load and manipulate raster data (visit the GeoTrellis documentation and GitHub pages for more information).</description>

      <description>This fall the sprint was held at Mozilla&amp;#8217;s Toronto office. 48 students from 18 Canadian universities came together to work on nine different open source projects with their mentors. The sprint gave students the chance to know each other, their projects, and their mentors so they could get down to work for the term (in addition to some time hanging out in Toronto).
Christian Hammond, one of the Review Board mentors provides an overview of how the sprint went for the Review Board team.</description>

      <description>While students are enjoying a summer away from school (or at least that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;d like to think you are doing), we are putting all the pieces in place for UCOSP next year.
We had a very successful year with students from 25 Canadian universities participating. The enthusiasm and energy that students and mentors brought to the code sprints in Waterloo and Menlo Park was fantastic.
We recently learned that Google will once again be our primary sponsor.</description>

      <description>Here is the first blog post from Umple, written by Geoffrey Guest.
Flying has never been a joy of mine, however, we made it here in one piece
so I guess I can&amp;#8217;t really complain. I met up with another UCOSPer, purely
by coincedence, on the way down. It turns out we both fit the bill of
&amp;#8220;computer science student&amp;#8221; in our own imaginations. The weekend was already
shaping up to be an excellent social and academic experience.</description>

      <description>This term&amp;#8217;s code sprint was held at Facebook Headquarters in California. Holding the sprint outside of Canada was a first for UCOSP, but it enabled us to join up with 110 students from several US and International schools that were also holding a similar weekend hackfest on the Facebook campus. This term 43 students from 19 Canadian universities are working on 7 different projects. Photos to follow.</description>

      <description>Stuart Erskine checks in from the UMPLE team.
Umple is a powerful tool for Model-Oriented Programming. It allows the
programmer to work on a more abstract level by generating code automatically for attributes, associations and state machines. This eliminates the writing of a lot of _boiler plate code_ when developing and speed up the development process. We are so confident in Umple&amp;#8217;s code generating capabilities that *we even write Umple using Umple* 🙂</description>

      <description>UCOSP 2012 is off and running following a successful code sprint in Kitchener Waterloo last weekend. We have 58 students from 16 different Canadian universities working on 8 projects this term and from everything I saw and heard, the sprint was a great success.
The UCOSP program operates under the Canadian Association of Computer Science (CACS/AIC). Michelle Craig, chair of the UCOSP steering committee, attended the CACS/AIC Chairs meeting in the spring and once again promoted the program, so we are able to welcome even more universities to the program.</description>

Bright and early on Friday we all met up for some breakfast buffet and walked over to CommuniTech for some really fun ice-breaker games where of course we paralleled processed our way to a win!</description>

Hi! I’m Wilson Yeung and I’m in my last semester at Simon Fraser University where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computing Science. I joined the Review Board team because an opportunity was presented to the computing undergrads at SFU to join UCOSP. Despite having high expectations, I am still surprised at how fulfilling this experience is. Being enclosed in a controlled learning environment at university, I was excited to work on something that had real life applications and meaning to the outside world.</description>

My experience with UCOSP has been very fulfilling thus far. I’ve met a lot of great people, and have enjoyed working on the Review Board project more than I ever would have expected. One of my favourite aspects of the program is the feeling that your contributions are significant; The code you write is distributed to and executed by real users. This is in stark contrast to the usual work which is done in university.</description>

It has been a really good experience. I&amp;#8217;ll start off by mentioning what has been going on with the others students.
To begin with we&amp;#8217;ve had James who has been diligent in working on enhancing the capabilities of the compiler, by enabling additional command line options.</description>

Recently I have been introduced to two new development tools; GitHub and ReviewBoard. In this blog I am going to talk a little bit about each and my experience with using these tools.
GitHub is one of the largest code hosting applications, which provides an ease of sharing codes online and allows other coders to contribute to different projects. GitHub has several advantages; it fuses the best features of a social networking site with a code-sharing forum.</description>

We all know Review Board is great for allowing a distributed team to effectively ensure only high quality, standards complaint code is integrated into the end product. But what else makes Review Board great?
From my experiences on the team I can safely say it gives new developers a leg up on the learning curve when starting. I was able to leverage Review Board to quickly learn exactly what I should, and should not be doing in my code.</description>

      <description>I am Anthony Mok, and I am in my last term of the Computer Science program at the University of Waterloo. I picked the Review Board project for UCOSP due to favourable past experiences with the software and a desire to want to contribute to the community; it also felt like a good opportunity to learn new skills and technologies. I met the other students and Mike from the Review Board UCOSP team for the first time this weekend at the Code Sprint at UBC.</description>

      <description>The Umple project is advancing rapidly this semester with three UCOSP students making major contributions in parallel with other contributors.
UCOSP students are have tackled some smaller features and bugs, and are now working on a couple of long-standing major issues: Generating comprehensive and useful error messages, and getting rid of certain syntax oddities.
Dr. Lethbridge, the project mentor, just posted a blog post that covers the recent work in technical detail:</description>

      <description>The UCOSP sprint this fall was held at the University of Toronto Department of Computer Science September 23 &amp;#8211; 25. Students and project mentors came together from across the country to meet their teams and start working on their projects. Some photos from the code sprint are included in the gallery below.

      <description>Hi everyone,
Just a quick status update from the EOL team here: we have met each other at last at the fantastic UCOSP code sprint in Toronto!
At the code sprint, we learned a lot of things. Our awesome mentors Dmitry and Lisa started off by teaching us how to use Git and instructing us on the proper commit workflow for the EOL project hosted on Github.
We then spent the remainder of the code sprint setting up our development environments.</description>

      <description>Lots of things are happening behind the scenes as we gear up for UCOSP again this fall. Faculty across Canada are recruiting students, we are busy trying to collect a few more projects and finalize the ones we have tentatively arranged, and we are still looking for more sponsors.
We are very grateful to Google for agreeing to be our major sponsor for the second year in a row. We are also grateful for the enthusiastic support of the CACS/AIC (the association of Canadain computer science chairs).</description>

      <description>Now that we have reached the middle of the term it is a great time for a blog post in order to see where we stand.&amp;nbsp;
 Since the beginning of the term, we got all introduced to the POSIT app and got familiar with it&amp;#8217;s components and architecture. In order to warm up, each of us started to look into some re-factoring and testing tasks. We identified few issues that were worth tackling but were also minor enough such that we could accomplish them in a short amount of time.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since the code sprint and everyone is settling down nicely. Apart from other courses, there haven&amp;#8217;t been any major road blocks the MarkUs team has faced. Everyone is using the resources they can to breeze through the problems with their various issues. Thanks to our amazing mentors, many of us have overcome the problems we&amp;#8217;ve encountered so far. The IRC channel provides a perfect place for efficient question and answer sprints while the mentors try to help everyone who&amp;#8217;s stuck.</description>

      <description>We are now well underway in our ReviewBoard projects, though, like everyone, its a challenge to balance both UCOSP and the rest of our courses/lives/commitments. In addition, for some of us it seems our progress is pretty slow for the moment as we are still trying to learn the languages &amp;amp; digging down to see all the nit &amp;amp; grit of ReviewBoard!
I&amp;#8217;m currently working on the scalability testing for ReviewBoard &amp;amp; its quite an interesting process to say the least.</description>

      <description>From Feb 3rd to Feb 17th, we continued to work on implementing some of the core features of CoRAL, including searching, uploading and claiming publications, changing user profile settings. Except searching, only logged in user has access to these features.
Most of our work is on the user&amp;#8217;s profile page, and we have made a lot of changes to both the user interface and functionality. In settings tab, user can change his/her information to be private or public, or modify some personal information, including password.</description>

      <description>At the amazing code sprint, we became familiar with our teammates, git and Reviewboard and now after the kick-off, we begin to dive into Reviewboard.
It is first step that costs troublesome, especially when there are quite a lot of new stuffs (e.g. python, django, git, Reviewboard, etc ) Sometimes we don’t know where to go and sometimes we mess up the code. Fortunately, there are people we know we can turn to for help—our mentors!</description>

      <description>After the code sprint, from Jan 27-Feb 03, we continued to become more familiar with the code base, and began working on implementing some of the core features of CoRAL. These features include the authentication of users, and the uploading of publications. A new login page was created, which will allow users to log in and out of the site. Ultimately this will restrict the functionality on the website (such as uploads) until a user has logged in.</description>

      <description>Last week, members of the MarkUs team, new and old from all over Canada had the opportunity to meet at the University of Alberta in Edmonton to get some work done at the January 2011 UCOSP Code Sprint. The group had a great time and I feel we&amp;#8217;ve really started out strong for the up-coming work term.
One of the coolest parts of the Code Sprint was the chance to get together with MarkUs team members face-to-face.</description>

      <description>CoRAL (Collaborative Review Analysis of Literature) aims to support and to analyze collaborative review of research literature in science. CoRAL supports collaborative review by providing a multi-format document browser which enables users to create and share annotations (the CoRAL viewer). Annotations provide means for commenting, discussing, tagging, and highlighting. CoRAL also supports both analysis and reviewing by generating visualized reports about how users collaborate and how researchers show attention to various pieces of literature (CoRAL reporter).</description>

      <description>A guest post by the CoRAL team.
Since this project was conceptualized and named in early October, we have made great strides in designing a user and application programming interface for visualizing activity on CoRAL (Collaborative Review Analysis of Literature) and to be used in tandem with the Fab4Browser. CoRAL/Fab4 is an academic publication browser that allows users to comment, discuss and annotate academic papers. It was designed to facilitate discussion and development of ideas and encourage collaboration and sharing of viewpoints between different experts of the scientific community.</description>

If you’ve been following this blog, you’ll know that the team has been working very hard on their projects. But I’ll bet those status reports can be a bit cryptic sometimes.
So here’s my take on where we are so far, in no particular order:
 Hongbin has been working on an extension that will allow communication between Review Board and various bug-trackers.</description>

      <description>A guest post by team member Todd Ritchie.
The Basie/Pinax team has been working on a mailing list module for the next iteration of Basie. This module was designed with the intent of being able to decouple it from Basie and use it with any Pinax application. We started from scratch and during the code sprint we managed to get creation of mailing lists working, addition of subscribed e-mail lists, and walking of subscribed e-mails so that we can send messages.</description>

Things are going very well with the POSIT group. The students have now all identified appropriate projects and each is making steady progress on their work. We have been meeting every Thursday for a brief Skype conference during which we discuss any issues that come up.</description>

      <description>The CoRAL team (formerly known as fab4) has been making great progress on our task.
The task is to develop a visualization service for the fab4 browser project, whose objective is to support communities of readers by allowing them to share their comments on the documents they read. The original fab4 project simply provides a canvas on which to place and view annotations of different types on a document.
In our work, we assume that the fab4 user community consists of researchers either reviewing papers for the purpose of writing surveys and related-research sections of new publications or for the purpose of accepting/rejecting papers submitted to a conference.</description>

      <description>This weekend, over 50 students and project mentors gathered in Toronto for this semester&amp;#8217;s code sprint.

Why go through all the trouble and expense of bringing students together to a single physical location to work on their projects? Isn&amp;#8217;t the point of UCOSP to teach students to work in a distributed environment? Yes, but from experience, we&amp;#8217;ve found that when teams are able to meet even once, the odds of success are dramatically increased.</description>

      <description>OSCON? What&amp;#8217;s OSCON?
 A keynote talk at OSCON   OSCON brings together people like you from across the open source universe to learn, inspire each other, and collaborate.
 If our mission is to get students working on cool open source projects, what better place to look for mentors?
In addition, we were interested in how other people are teaching open source software in academia. Luckily, OSCON had lots of people with something to say on the topic.</description>

      <description>UCOSP, the distributed undergraduate capstone course, is preparing for another year and we need your help!
Forgot what UCOSP is? Here&amp;#8217;s a refresher.
 Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Projects brings together students from coast to coast to work together on joint capstone projects. Students learn first-hand what distributed development is like. Each team has students from two or three schools, and uses a mix of agile and open source processes under the supervision of a faculty or industry lead.</description>

      <description>Almost all of this term&amp;#8217;s students have sent in their self-evaluations, and their evaluations of their mentors. Overall, people seem to have enjoyed working on things that are actually going to be used, and getting to know their peers and their industry mentors. There are a few things we need to do better next time&amp;#8212;clearer goals for some projects, some grades midway through term so that people know where they stand, etc.</description>

      <description>Our FlightSim project has come to a close last week, after posting our final delieverable. It&amp;#8217;s been a long ride, so I thought I should take my time to write down my experience and what I&amp;#8217;ve learned here.
Different from most of you, our project started at IBM&amp;#8217;s lab, not at the St. George campus. On our first morning, all of us were invited to their lab at Markham. The lab itself is a really cool place, and the IBMers have treated us well.</description>

      <description>This week is another productive week for Thunderbird Team in that most of us have finished most of their work!
Wei Xian has resolved his bug (restore session) and his patch has been pushed to comm-central. Also, he is going to prepare a &amp;#8220;quick start guide&amp;#8221; for future students who are going to work on Thunderbird. For myself, I have posted my revised patch and get the review from Blake. Now I have submitted a secondary review request and hopefully everything is going all right.</description>

      <description>Today marks the last day of classes at the University of Waterloo, and so ends the official portion of the UCOSP project for Tessa, Wendy, and myself. During our last meeting on April 1st, we tied some loose ends on our patches and discussed our experiences in the project. I will save the details for the final reports, but we all agreed that we&amp;#8217;d like to continue contributing to Mercurial as time permits.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;The real challenge of GSoC is not the coding, it&amp;#8217;s learning to work with a community,&amp;#8221; wrote Matt Mackall to the Mercurial mailing list a couple days ago with regard to the upcoming Google Summer of Code projects: http://selenic.com/pipermail/mercurial/2010-April/030996.html
I believe this applies equally well to us: the real challenge of UCOSP is not the coding, it&amp;#8217;s learning to work with a community. This is especially true for the Mercurial team because we are working with such a large, established, global community of developers.</description>

      <description>Apologies this is coming late, I didn&amp;#8217;t notice I was set as the blog poster for this week!
It seems like several of us are having difficulties with unit tests, with myself and Zach having trouble getting working unit tests off the ground, and Wei Xian adding some polish to his previous unit tests.
Also, Tim and I are feeling the crunch of other courses so haven&amp;#8217;t been productive over the last week.</description>

Status  Looked further into Bug 303420: Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu. This may not actually be a task I can accomplish before the code freeze, taking into account the other things I had also intended to finish before then.  Final Steps  Look into Bug 303420: Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu. Go back to Bug 299342: &amp;ldquo;New Java Package&amp;rdquo; option should automatically create a Java Project, to use the NewJavaProjectConstructor to create the default project.</description>

      <description>For some of us on the Mercurial crew next week is the closing chapter of the UCOSP adventure. Tessa, Wendy and Anton from Waterloo will be finishing their term, and with that their contributions to Mercurial as part of the program. That&amp;#8217;s not to say they&amp;#8217;ll be done with Mercurial for good—the general consensus is that we all had a great time. Paul and myself still have until mid-April to get the remainder of our work submitted.</description>

      <description>Victoria Status  Brainstormed ideas for the Dashboard. Went through draft Dashboard contents with Karen and Farah and got some good and constructive feedback  Next Steps  With the feedback I got back regarding the potential Dashboard contents, come up with a preliminary prototype &amp;#8212; one that we can take apart and help establish a better idea as to how we&amp;#8217;d like to design the Dashboard.  Roadblocks  Swamped with work (from my full-time position).</description>

      <description>We had a brief meeting today and here is the summary.
Present: Brenda, Cory
Absent: Miles
Drag and Drop
&amp;#8211; Cory is still plugging away at implementing this, as it is not a small task. If anyone is interested in looking at it and providing feedback, it would be beneficial.
&amp;#8211; He is also wondering if anyone has priorities or features in mind in regards to drag and drop.

General Comments for tutorials:
 The page of ugly columns can be shown in a better way in TE, Matthew will provide further information The ad-hoc is now split into 2 panels, this can be displayed in 2 panels instead of split panels The column rendering can be used to show the values on the dial, so dials can display a wider range  General Update</description>

      <description>Brenda Status  Reworked the patch for Bug 303426 to fix the problem Wayne noted. I found the solution to Bug 303581 and included it in this patch as the code greatly overlapped and the problems were related. Made note of this in Bug 303581. Started investigating into Bug 303420 (Simplify the user experience when renaming a type from the pop-up menu) to see how this should be done. I have the main outline coded, but I&amp;#8217;m still figuring out how to pull in the refactoring functionality to use in conjunction with this code.</description>

      <description>Brenda Status  Submitted a patch for Bug 303426 that fixes the unresolved issues with the previous patch. The package dropdown menu should now list the packages in the currently selected project, and update when a different project is chosen. The patch also makes sure the default package is listed as &amp;ldquo;(default package)&amp;rdquo; rather than a blank line.  Next Steps  Look into issues with the NewJavaClassConstructor class. Specifically, address Bug 303581 and several of the TODOs and FIXMEs in the code where possible.</description>

He made the fix and submitted the patch. Submitted a patch for Bug 303426 (Class Creation Wizard lists projects in the package selection menu). It fixes the main problem, but is not complete yet.  Next Steps  Implement the second step for Bug 303426 so that the list of packages updates when the currently chosen project is changed.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t believe we&amp;#8217;re halfway through the term. Congratulations to all the progress you&amp;#8217;ve made, everyone!
Initial expectations:
 Apply what I&amp;#8217;ve learned from courses and work. Check. Explore techniques that I haven&amp;#8217;t had the chance to practice at work. E.g. Personas, but that&amp;#8217;s on the back-burner. Collaborate closely with the developers. See below.  What&amp;#8217;s going well:
 I think the code sprint at the beginning of the term has been invaluable in terms of motivation.</description>

      <description>For many of the same reasons raised below, I haven&amp;#8217;t been as productive as I had expected; in particular, this has largely resulted from the intersection between front-heavy term workloads and the various bureaucratic demands of graduation/full-time employment.
That said, I finally posted my vCard import patch for review this past week, along with some modifications as suggested by Standard8. This patch involves roughly 800 lines of code in the middle of the complex multi-threaded wonder that is Address Book; it even comes complete with xpcshell-based tests (which pass!</description>

      <description>The Basie team has made considerable progress this term, both on the software, and in learning how to work together effectively. One member dropped out due to over-commitment, but most of the others pushed hard to get Version 0.6 out i time for me to take it to the Python Conference in Atlanta, where we got a lot of useful feedback. We&amp;#8217;re on track to do another release (Version 0.7) at the end of term or shortly after.</description>

      <description>As contrasted with some of my students, I&amp;#8217;m fairly happy with the amount of coding work they&amp;#8217;ve gotten done. I think this is largely because I had more realistic expectations coming in to the course. After 15 years in industry I&amp;#8217;ve come to realize that there&amp;#8217;s a whole lot more to fixing bugs than fixing the bug, and the other stuff is what takes the time. Stuff like figuring out what&amp;#8217;s going wrong, and how the code fits together, writing tests, getting it reviewed, fixing the things the reviewer points out, getting it committed, and (hopefully) writing up their weekly status reports.</description>

Quickly, you are looking at is a simulation of a specific problems what can occur within a database system. The problem is then identified using the SQL monitoring functionality available within DB2 and then that mass of information refined into some simple prototype indicators.</description>

      <description>It has been a very good learning experience for me to work with Mercurial team so far.
What I learned:
To be honest, I had no experience in python coding or Mercurial at the beginning of the semester. I was terrified that I had no idea how to start my worm-up project tagmerge extension at the code sprint. Thankfully, Benjamin was really patient with me and guided me where to start off.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone,
this is my midterm report for Basie project.
The first part of the project was to fix bugs to have a good representation for PyCon. Version 0.6 is now released and we can now work on 0.7 release.
I&amp;#8217;m working with Guillaume Simard for 0.7, our goal is to add front-end test for the entire application. To do that, we will use Selenium. The setup to use Selenium is praticaly completed and we have 7 weeks left to write tests for every apps in Basie.</description>

      <description>This is my midterm update of the Flight Simulator project
As the team lead on the student side for the first time in my life, I can feel the responsibility and challenge from my role all the time. I am basically using agile methodology I experienced in my previous coop work team and it turned out that everything worked out quite well. Tickets are opened and closed on time, and deliverables are officially accepted by IBM on the delivering date, so we can tell that the team is well on-track.</description>

      <description>The progress of the term is going well since the deliverables are completed on time and the IBM folks are satisfied with them. The most important feeling in this project is that, although we are physically in three different cities, two different time zones, we are able to keep up the communication and plans. Each of us are assigned with a task, complete it on time, and merge all of our work into one deliverable, and this cycle goes on, even though all of us are busy with other things at the same time.</description>

      <description>This term’s version of IDE4EDU is much the same as last terms. The output of our three students (Brenda, Cory and Miles) has been comparable to last term’s effort and Wayne and I are happy with their consistent progress. On the communication side, there has not been as much online traffic as last term, but that has not seemed to prevent the group from moving forward.
Like last term, the main issue IDE4EDU faces is the action of committing code.</description>

      <description>I have to say I&amp;#8217;m disappointed with my progress so far &amp;#8211; not so much in terms of understanding the code and bug fixing, but more in terms of turning my lines working code into accepted patches (and all the communication and time management that goes along with that).
Code
Toronto was a great opportunity to learn about the deep inner workings of the Mozilla codebase (an opportunity which, considering the size and scope of the code, was invaluable).</description>

      <description>Wow, has this semester ever gone by fast &amp;#8212; I can&amp;#8217;t believe that we only have six weeks left until the end of term! Working on Basie has been quite the learning experience. I had never worked on an open-source project before starting on this project, and I knew very little about Django. Over the past two months I&amp;#8217;ve learned a tremendous amount about both. It&amp;#8217;s been great getting to know the tools of the trade (ticketing systems, the reviewboard, etc) and working as part of a team.</description>

      <description>Here is my midterm report for the Data Center Flight Simulator project.
At first we were not sure about what we had to do and what IBM was waiting from us. Fortunately it became clearer by the end of the first week with the help of Matthew, from IBM.
Since the beginning of this project we have mostly investigated how to detect and create saturations from different part of the system using the DB2 database.</description>

      <description>The term started off with an earlier Code Sprint kickoff than last term and this definitely helped get things in motion much quicker and allowed us to address problems much earlier on which I found was most helpful this term as our team ran into a series of dependent environment setup issues that delayed a lot of the work. The goals and requirements of the project were fairly vague at first, but despite these early setbacks, I found that the team I am working with this term (compared to my last term with UCOSP) is a lot more self-driven and willing to communicate, ask questions, keep each other updated and help each other out.</description>

      <description>Working on Basie has been a blast! And the team, they&amp;#8217;re really a first-class bunch. Well, to quote Greg, Basie has seen a &amp;ldquo;flurry of activity&amp;rdquo; in the recent weeks as we prepared to debut Basie 0.6. We have all done tremendous work fixing many outstanding bugs, discovering new issues and solutions, refactoring a bunch of code, and redesigning the interface.
These past few months I&amp;#8217;ve worked mostly on fixing old issues and redesigning the Dashboard.</description>

      <description>Never worked on an open-source project before, it has proven to be challenging for me to run different scripts and commands in an open-source environment. It has been a huge learning curve for me to adjust to open-source programs when I was babied all these years by GUI applications and Windows. Although we are half-way through the term, we still have a lot of development work to do. The setup of the environment took awhile as there are so many configurations that are required for this project.</description>

      <description>The time is running so fast that it is already the middle of the term. It has been a quite exciting time for me since I joined UCOSP, joined my team – MarkUs. After 2 months work with our team, I feel more confident in working for MarkUs.
What I have learned
For the technique aspect, I am more familiar with Rails development. I have learned setting up the workspace for Rails, basic Ruby syntax and basic way of Rails development.</description>

      <description>Summary:
Things are going slower than expected. I thought I would be able to get so much more done. The first few weeks were spent on my first changelist. My expectation was to be done with the first week [8]. I have learned tons about Ruby, Rails, Rails plugins and javascript. I am currently working on replaced the AJAX pagination with serverside pagination on the submissions page. Afterwards, I will be working on the detailed view for the submissions page.</description>

My work at Thunderbird is mainly to fix a bug regarding to the “Reply To List” feature. By working on this bug, I am expecting to get myself further exposed to real industrialized products based on my computing science knowledge gained from previous school and work experience.
What I have done so far and What have I learned
First of all, I have to say that my ability to analyze problems is greatly enhanced through working on Thunderbird, which is a complicated software comprising million lines of code.</description>

      <description>Hi all,
The first few weeks has been simply non-productive since we had to find a way to install everything on our machines. No useful documentation was available for us to make this quick so we had to tweak files to make everything works. What&amp;#8217;s nice about that is that now, documentation exists because we took the time to write some detailed tutorials for every OS (Windows/Linux/Mac). It&amp;#8217;s always nice of being able to work on his favorite OS and not having to reboot to do so.</description>

      <description>Expectations, Status &amp;amp; Progress
Coming into this UCOSP project course, my ultimate goal was to be able to utilize the human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) design knowledge that I’ve acquired from both school and work to enhance the usability of MarkUs. Through this experience, I’m hoping to solidify my understanding of various usability concepts and familiarize myself with more projects out there.
Up until now, I feel that I’m on track with the work that I’m doing with MarkUs.</description>

      <description>Few months ago,when I first joined Pony-build, I was excited and eager to learn more about this project in particular and open-source in general. I knew my limited experience might make my progress slower than expected but I was determined to learn more no matter what.
I couldn&amp;#8217;t join the UCOSP community for the &amp;#8220;Code Sprint&amp;#8221; in Canada; however, I started to communicate with the project lead Titus C. Brown and the rest of the group via Skype to make the initial system set ups.</description>

      <description>My overall progress is a bit slower than I expected, because environment setup took me too long in early February. But I have started implementing actual code and current progress seems good.
The main difficulty I have had so far is setting up development and testing environment. A large scale open source project such as geotools requires me to install and configure a lot of programs before development starts. Therefore, this setup progress is time-consuming and requires attention to detail.</description>

      <description>UCOSP has been an adventure for me. From the time I made my mind to participate in this program, I have had lot of different/ new experiences. Getting excited about attending the code sprint and then getting denied for the visa was the first one. For once, I thought I won’t be able to participate in UCOSP. But fortunately, I still could. With the help of Skype, we had a virtual code sprint for our group, Pony-Build.</description>

      <description>I am not proud to say this, but my performance on Thunderbird could have been better.
Am I behind?
 Yes, I am at least three weeks behind the schedule I set for myself. I would have liked to submit my first patch by the end of January, but I ended up doing that only in the third week of February. At the start of the term, I broke down the feature I was responsible for implementing into reasonably sized pieces and estimated that each piece will take approximately 1-2 days to implement.</description>

      <description>My first degree is in engineering, and while I&amp;#8217;m too clumsy to have ever actually practiced [1], the courses I took still shape the way I look at things. In particular, I still enjoy articles like this one,which reports parse and load times for Javascript on various platforms. I really wish that a course on systems performance was a standard part of every undergrad CS degree; I doubt that&amp;#8217;ll happen any time soon, but this stuff is out there if you look for it.</description>

      <description>Wow, it&amp;#8217;s already half way through the term. Working with Greg and the Basie team has been a great experience. I am glad that I chose Basie as the project to work with, as I got to learn Django and Python. I feel that I&amp;#8217;m working at a pretty good pace with Basie, but sometimes I feel that I&amp;#8217;m not doing enough when compared to the more experienced members on the team.</description>

      <description>When we set out at the beginning of UCOSP, my goal was for us to contribute significantly to Mercurial by the end of the semester. How well have we accomplished that goal so far?
At the beginning of the semester, all of the students were given small, self-contained bug fixes and features that we&amp;#8217;d discovered people wanted over the course of developing Kiln, mostly in the form of Mercurial extensions. Four of these were quickly completed: cedit, a command-line-based way to configure Mercurial; cache-annotations, which makes annotating files repeatedly ridiculously fast; globexclude, which allows you to exclude files based on their glob pattern when doing conversions to Mercurial; and caseguard, which warns you when you are committing files that have names that will prevent Mac and Windows users from using your repository.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to put in one day a week towards this project and I&amp;#8217;ve pretty much managed to do that. I think my major goals for this semester are to get the new Java class wizards and classes in good shape and get a good handle on simplifying the menus and toolbars by the end of the semester.</description>

      <description>Two months have passed since I joined Markus in Undergraduate Capstone Open Source Project (UCOSP). I thought it was just another course, but it&amp;#8217;s a completely different than every other one I&amp;#8217;ve ever taken.
The most noticeable difference is that no instructor is around! In a regular course, I am told how to do stuffs. I sit in a comfortable chair in the classroom, follow the instructions given by teachers and do best I to meet their expectation.</description>

      <description>We had a brief meeting today; here is what we discussed.
Present: Miles, Cory and Brenda
Absent: No one
Naming
&amp;#8211; Educlipse (or EduEclipse) is short, concise and demonstrates what it is – a version of Eclipse meant for education.
&amp;#8211; Eclipse IDE for Education fits well with the naming schemes for other Eclipse products.
&amp;#8211; The consensus between us still seems to be Educlipse or EduEclipse, however.
Templates
&amp;#8211; Discussed opening an extension point for the templates; we shouldn’t need more than 2-4 templates ourselves.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone, this is my midway update.  Well.. technically this is my midway update. However, since I&amp;#8217;m a student at Université Laval we started our semester slightly later than the rest of Canada and it&amp;#8217;s going to be over by the end of April. I plan on working on Basie until the end of my term so that means that I still have more time in front of me to get things done.</description>

      <description>Brenda Status  Looked further into the use of plugin_customization.ini for setting the default perspective and it seems this file is created when we compile a standalone RCP App. Cory posted details on its use in Bug 299869. Submitted bug reports 303425, 303426 and 303427, related to the Class and Package wizards. Submitted a patch that alters my previous patch for hiding packages and source folders so that all source folders are hidden, not just those named &amp;ldquo;src&amp;rdquo; Looked into the other issue Wayne found with this patch (project explorer view not always updating), but haven&amp;#8217;t come to a solution yet.</description>

      <description>warm-up I&amp;#8217;ve used open-source software for the last 7 years (which is feels like a blip in Internet time). I was aware since the beginning that these projects thrive on contributions from people all over the world. And I knew that these tools had bugs and had roadmaps with desired features waiting on some developer to tackle. But before UCOSP I&amp;#8217;ve never made a solid contribution to anything. I always imagined expert programmers are the only ones that have a business getting involved in these projects and submitting patches and extensions.</description>

      <description>The first half of the semester has flown by quickly. Like last semester, I&amp;#8217;m really enjoying being a part of the MarkUs team! It was nice to already have my development environment from last semester all set and ready to go for this semester. Since I didn&amp;#8217;t have to spend any time on setup, I was able to jump back into the code right away. I&amp;#8217;ve found that things make a lot more sense to me now than they did around the same time last semester.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m pretty happy with both my progress so far and the progress of our entire team (Mercurial). As Anton and Tessa have mentioned, we hit a bit of a slow period recently with bfiles but I think that&amp;#8217;s natural. We had an exceptionally productive first month and a bit (largely thanks to the code sprint!). Every person on our team contributed non-trivial extensions that tangibly increased the usability of Mercurial. I think that is something we should be very proud of.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m definitely feeling better about working on projects with _huge_ codebases like Thunderbird. I&amp;#8217;m currently working on a patch to add a &amp;#8220;Reopen last tab&amp;#8221; button to Thunderbird. I&amp;#8217;m finally feeling like I know my way around Thunderbird&amp;#8217;s tab management code. I submitted a patch a couple weeks ago and got some feedback, and I&amp;#8217;ve done most of what the patch suggested. The only thing left to do before I submit my patch again is to figure out why the UI tests sometimes pass and sometimes fail on my computer (even without my patch applied!</description>

      <description>This semester has not been as productive as I would have liked. I set out to fix a single bug in Thunderbird that I thought would be cool to do. Before I left code sprint I found I had to fix another bug first to add support to fix the original. Doing so would put my code in the base Mozilla library, which was used for Firefox also, so I thought this was exceptionally cool.</description>

      <description>Working on Basie has been a great learning experience. There are always plenty of things to work on and learn from. The people are also great, I feel privileged to be able to work with a group of students who are so hard working and care so much about the project.
Like any project the ramp up time is the most painful. I feel that the ramp up time for Basie has been longer than I had hoped.</description>

      <description>Simply put, I&amp;#8217;m dissatisfied with my performance with MarkUs.  Up until now, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing what could be considered the bare minimum of work to get a passing &amp;#8220;grade&amp;#8221; for UCOSP. This is my final school term which means I&amp;#8217;m looking to the future a lot this term, searching for full time employment. While I&amp;#8217;ve been very successful in this endeavour to tell the truth, it does mean that certain trade offs have been made which have not been to MarkUs&amp;#8217; benefit.</description>

      <description>So far, Eclipse4Edu has been a very useful experience for me. It’s the first project I’ve worked on where the codebase wasn’t written entirely by myself or by my team of 2-3 students. This has definitely been difficult, but like I said, useful. That combined with the complex framework and abstraction of Eclipse has made tasks that seem relatively trivial suddenly much more time-consuming. I’ve spent a fair amount of time simply looking through the code to familiarize myself with how things were implemented by others that have worked on the project.</description>

      <description>In General, I feel that I started the term out well, but I am presently falling behind my expectations, the “midterm slump” as Benjamin calls it. Within the first few weeks of the term had I submitted my bug fix to the Mercurial mailing list. I hoped that each week I would have completed some tangible amount of coding, whether it be implementing a small bit of functionality or fixing a bug in last week’s work.</description>

      <description>We are half-way through the term and I am enjoying working on Basie a lot. I think in our team we didn&amp;#8217;t have much time to play around and get used to the project because 0.6 was planned soon. This gave a very energetic push in the beginning of the year, and 0.7 is something that pushes me to try my best and do work in time now, when 0.6 is out.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that we are already 1&amp;frasl;2 way through the UCOSP Mercurial project. It has been an amazing learning experience from both a technical and a social point of view.
I started out this project with some limited experience of using Mercurial on my own system. Not only did I have to learn Mercurial in the context of a team, but I also had to put myself in the shoes of users very different from myself.</description>

      <description>A former boss of mine had a sign on the wall in his office that said, &amp;#8220;Out there, right now, someone is writing a queue and getting it wrong.&amp;#8221; What he meant was that if you&amp;#8217;re using a mature language like Java or Python, you should never have to deal with textbook data structures, dates and times, currencies, and other things directly: someone else will always have been there first. So, if you find yourself wrestling with timezones or passwords, fire up your favorite search engine and see what it turns up.</description>

      <description>We spent the first week or two setting things up and play around with DB2. Getting everything we need up and running was a bit tricky, because some major pieces of our toolkit is still in its infancy. Therefore, I spent quite a lot of time documenting my experience on the developer&amp;#8217;s wiki because I believe this would help students that are joining this project in future semesters (as well as our teamates).</description>

      <description>Ingres support for Geotools has been progressing well. However, although we are already half way thru the term, we still have quite a ways to go, so we are beginning to pick up the pace a bit.
Comments and Observations:
&amp;#8211; It seems like there is a lot of overhead and learning compared to the actually size of the code being developed. This has been a great learning opportunity, although it seems like given the learning curve, it would have been more effective if this project was longer than just one term.</description>

      <description>The Ingres/Geotools team finally began work on actual implementation of classes and unit tests for the classes in Geotools at this halfway point. I personally feel that we are falling a little bit behind schedule, not beyond managable. We took our time in the initial phase afraid of making mistakes that compromises the quality of the output. The Ingres/Geotools team has have a lot to explore in the geospatial world as a toddler would have the world.</description>

      <description>So I guess its that time &amp;#8211; reading week just finished, and we are halfway through the term &amp;#8211; yikes!
In the Eclipse4Edu camp, we are starting to get into the thick of the project. I won&amp;#8217;t lie, it was a pretty slow start&amp;#8230; programming the Eclipse framework is large, complex, and has a layer of abstraction for everything. I like to consider myself fairly competent with Java, but the Eclipse framework almost always has a different (sometimes non-intuitive) alternative solution to everything.</description>

2) Fatima has been working on getting her coverage build script finished up and working, as well as refining the HgClone implementation in the pony-build client.</description>

Long story short, they think that you kids rock, and I think a lot of them will want to be involved if we do this again in the fall. Thank you all for making me look so good&amp;#8212;I&amp;#8217;m proud to be working with you.</description>

      <description>This is my second semester joining the UCOSP with Ingres. From the lessons that I have learnt last term, I have planned my schedule out at the start from reading off the requirements of this semester and so far I am sticking to it quite well. I have completed half of the required patches.
Not only I found myself matured in how to co-operate with people working oversea, but also in self-monitoring.</description>

Brenda
&amp;#8211; Fixed the patch to Bug 299965 to hide all source folders, not just those named “src”.
&amp;#8211; Is looking into the issue with the project explorer view not updating under the circumstances that Wayne brought up in that bug. It could be that elements are being filtered out and the refresh code is looking at the same list of elements and thus doesn’t know the elements exist.</description>

      <description>Brenda Status  I didn&amp;#8217;t look as much into Scheme as I had intended because in our conference call, Wayne mentioned that the code provided likely can&amp;#8217;t be committed. I decided to look into some other bugs instead. Submitted a patch for Bug 301718 to update the Build Your First Program cheat sheet. Submitted a patch for Bug 299459 to allow the user to rename files (since refactoring has been removed).</description>

Everyone did her and his share to put this release out of the door and once we take a little break to catch up on our lives and other courses, we&amp;#8217;ll be back working hard to make 0.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m speaking at PyCon on Saturday. The blurb I sent in says:
 What We&amp;#8217;ve Learned From Building Basie
Since September 2008, teams of undergraduates from half a dozen different universities have been building a Django-based replacement for Trac called Basie. This talk will present what they&amp;#8217;ve accomplished and discuss what we&amp;#8217;ve learned about getting junior developers who are juggling half a dozen projects at once to build production-quality code.</description>

      <description>Thanks to a leading question from Pierre Lafayette, Joel Spolsky mentioned us in a recent postcast &amp;#8212; you can listen to the whole thing at http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4403.html (around the 40-minute mark). Yay us! But I do have to correct one thing: in response to Pierre pointing out that $2000 is a bit pricey for most undergrads, Joel says, &amp;#8220;Just ask your university library to get it for you.&amp;#8221; In reality, university library budgets are being slashed left, right, and center; asking them to get anything that isn&amp;#8217;t obviously scholarly isn&amp;#8217;t going to go anywhere 🙁</description>

Max is working on virtual environment and git clone.
Fatima is working on build-coverage and hgClone.
Jacob is working on improving the user interface.
Khushboo is working on build-nose and svn.
Fatima and I are still having some problems getting the builds running.</description>

      <description>Here is a summary of what we&amp;#8217;ve been up to this week. As usual, the IRC transcript of the meeting and our more detailed status report are posted.
 Continued work on our our patches that were submitted last weeks Progress with bfiles:   Benjamin set up a Linode server for us to develop and test the network-related bfiles issues Continued discussion on the the mercurial-devel mailinglist with seasoned mercurial developers regarding our ideas for autorefresh and how to keep the bfiles in the respository in a consistant state  After we finished discussing UCOSP-specific issues, we move to the main Mercurial IRC channel where we further discussed getting rid of bfrefresh, and having the refresh happen automatically.</description>

      <description>Basie team is working hard to make 0.6 happen; Greg Wilson will be presenting this release at the PyCon 2010 in Atlanta. We seem to inhabit our mailing list, with occasional posts to the Basie blog, where we collect our status reports. Besides fixing many general bugs, we are concentrating on the usability, compatibility, and appearance improvements. Here is a list of status reports that were filed on the Basie blog over the last three weeks, but were missing from the UCOSP blog:</description>

      <description>Brenda Status  Submitted a patch for Bug 299965 so that the default package and src folder are hidden, but explicitly made packages and other source folders are not (for the sake of comparing different approaches to this problem). Submitted a patch for Bug 300388 to rename the Scheme interpreter extension point and schema.  Next Steps  Look into the Scheme perspective more and some of the bugs that have been opened in regards to that (for example, Bugs 299866, 299867 and 299868).</description>

      <description>Brenda Status  Submitted a patch for Bug 299965 so that projects made outside the Lite perspective will also hide packages (and the source folder). Explored and discussed other possibilities with respect to this bug (hiding all packages versus select ones, and making beginner, intermediate and advanced levels of Java Lite which determine whether or not packages are shown).  Next Steps  Try another angle for Bug 299965 based on Wayne&amp;#8217;s comments in the conference call and on the bug page.</description>

      <description>I posted a link last week to Evan Robinson&amp;#8217;s article explaining why crunch mode doesn&amp;#8217;t work. Coincidentally, Ruben Ortega&amp;#8217;s latest post on the ACM site asks, Why Do Software Developers Tolerate &amp;#8220;Crunch Time&amp;#8221;? His answer is &amp;#8220;progress&amp;#8221;, or at least, developers&amp;#8217; need to feel like they&amp;#8217;re making progress. A couple of paragraphs later, though, he says:
 It is unrealistic to deliver any project without going through some &amp;#8220;Crunch time.&amp;#8221;</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve all met them, and from time to time, we&amp;#8217;ve all been one of them&amp;#8230;
Anna knows more about every subject than everyone else on the team put together&amp;#8212;at least, she thinks she does. No matter what you say, she&amp;#8217;ll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows better. Annas are pretty easy to spot: if you keep track in team meetings of how often people interrupt one another, her score is usually higher than everyone else&amp;#8217;s put together.</description>

Everyone is starting to feel the pressure of their classes this semester, but despite this several of us are close to submitting our first patch. A common theme is difficulty understanding how to work with the Mozilla platform, but learning how to work with someone else&amp;#8217;s code is good experience for us all.</description>

      <description>After our conference call today, here&amp;#8217;s a summary of the current situation of what I&amp;#8217;ve been working on, as well as the direction this aspect of the project is going:
The past couple weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve been working on hiding references to packages (in the project explorer, as well as buttons and menus that allow the user to create a new package).
The concept that is being discussed is that we don&amp;#8217;t want the user to work in Java Lite for the first month or so of their course, then come to the point where they switch to the regular Java perspective and become overwhelmed by the sudden presence of many tools they have not been introduced to.</description>

      <description>We have made substantial progress towards getting our initial contributions ready for submitting to the mercurial-devel mailing list. This has been a week of testing and code reviews where we all learned something new about Mercurial and writing python code in general.
To summarize, you can expect the following extensions to be submitted to the mercurial mailing list in the next week:
 tagmerge (wendyY): support smart merging of tag files (tags are labels for specific commits or heads)  some fixes and testing, testing, testing  cedit (paulitex): command line and interactive editing of mercurial configuration files with shortcuts for common setup operations  submitted iniparse (external lib) changes upstream documentation, bootstrapping, testing, testing, testing  convert (Tessa): modifying the convert extension to support wildcards in exclude statements  order/precedence of include vs.</description>

If you make it to the bottom, you can see that I haven&amp;#8217;t done very much. Interviews take up so much time! It&amp;#8217;s a good problem to have, but I can&amp;#8217;t help be feel a bit of guilt for pushing MarkUs off to the side for them.
Because of the flexible nature of UCOSP, it&amp;#8217;s possible for me to do this. I&amp;#8217;m just using my banked up hours from the code-sprint sooner rather than later.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re on track to release Version 0.6 in time for PyCon (which is three weeks away), though we may get there by slapping the word &amp;#8220;beta&amp;#8221; after the &amp;#8220;0.6&amp;#8221; :-). Lots of bugs are being fixed; the ticketing system and milestone display are seeing significant re-work; and we&amp;#8217;re cleaning up code (e.g., pulling Javascript out of HTML pages and putting it in separate files, doing better error reporting). More importantly (at least for me), our work now has a rhythm: stuff is going up on ReviewBoard, getting checked, and getting committed on a pretty regular basis.</description>

      <description>So this week I&amp;#8217;m looking into resursive SQL queries. And my goa? To saturate the CPU with that 😀 So normally you&amp;#8217;d want to make your query fast and avoid O(n^2) queries as much as possible, but now I&amp;#8217;m doing the opposite and make it use as much CPU as possible. Kinda awesome you get to do that for a school project isn&amp;#8217;t it!</description>

      <description>Our project, Mercurial, already announced their participation in Google&amp;#8217;s Summer of Code 2010 via the developer mailing list. I suspect many other projects are doing the same, so even though there&amp;#8217;s no official information on Google&amp;#8217;s own SoC page (yet), you might want to consider preparing your application. If you&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed UCOSP so far and want to continue the experience, GSoC looks like a great avenue to do so.</description>

      <description>Brenda Status  Worked on Bug 299965 to hide packages from the user and posted a patch for the bug. An outstanding issue with this however is that if a project is made outside of Java Lite, the src folder and any packages within it are visible (that is, the patch works for projects made through the Java Lite project wizard only).  Next Steps  Work on the issue mentioned above so that projects made outside the Lite perspective will also hide packages (and the src folder).</description>

      <description>In the flight sim team we relied on skype for all non-verbal communication. It so happened that there is a global skype outage last Thursday right which happed to collide with our weekly team meeting&amp;#8217;s time. (Good thing that we are using IBM&amp;#8217;s conferce call infrastructure for our meeting.) Twitter again proved to be the best way to look for outage information like these &amp;#8211; a quick search for the #Skype hash tag quickly revealed to me that a lot of people are having the same problem, and eventually leads me to the official @Skype Twitter account.</description>

      <description>Since we couldn’t all meet for the Sprint code in Toronto, the first steps into pony-build were to get to speed with the software layout and with working with Git. We were constantly communicating via Skype and our group lead Pr. Titus was very patient and helpful throughout the process.
We first got the software running on Linux via Lyorn then on our own computer (on Windows and Mac). Then our next task was to write one of the client scripts for existing packages, commit it, and push it to Github.</description>

&amp;#8211; Buttons are easily hidden
&amp;#8211; Has been able to identify which elements of the package explorer are in fact packages, but is stuck on reworking the hierarchy so that the view skips over the package level

      <description>Spent two days out of commission this week after a botched attempt to improve the performance of my integrated Intel 945 chipset ended up freezing gdm on startup. Oops. Several failed attempts to rectify the fault by rolling back xorg.conf (this was not the problem, apparently), one careful repartitioning, a hasty install of Karmic, and countless apt-gets later, I&amp;#8217;m back in action. I note happily that the Karmic repos bundle mercurial 1.</description>

Status  Attended the Code Sprint Spent a lot of time looking through the code, getting an idea for the framework. Reported several bugs for the Java Lite perspective. Tested the patch for Bug 244645 (making a new class in an empty workspace). I agree with it and also posted a new bug (299342) with a patch that does the equivalent for making a new package. However, after the code sprint, we decided that packages should be done away with overall (that is, hidden).</description>

      <description>They say you can&amp;#8217;t manage what you don&amp;#8217;t measure. It&amp;#8217;s equally true of design: if you don&amp;#8217;t know who you&amp;#8217;re designing for, the odds are you&amp;#8217;re going to get something wrong. With that in mind, here are some stats from two universities on browser types:

So I will start off with a couple that we shared and learned about from the code sprint last weekend:
 plugin spy &amp;#8211; alt + shift + F2 (then click something to ID it) open file by name &amp;#8211; ctrl + shift + T delete whole line(s) without selecting all text &amp;#8211; ctrl + d comment out whole line(s) &amp;#8211; ctrl + / (Note: can be used to undo commented line too) Organize imports &amp;#8211; ctrl + shift + O Format source code &amp;#8211; ctrl + shift + F  </description>

      <description>The day before the sprint, I knew of nothing about what I should do and what I can do in this project. I woke up at 5 on Friday morning, took a taxi to the bus terminal, got onto Greyhound to Toronto, got lost on our way to Bahen Centre (we were on University and College, 5 minutes away from Bahen, lol) To my surprise, I arrived, and joined a team of people as lost as I was.</description>

      <description>As the dust settles from this years Spring Code Sprint, I am left with some interesting reflections. One, coding for 9 hours straight sure gets hard without proper caffeine intake, maybe an IV drip will be a good investment for the next one. Two, ordering lots of food when someone else is paying is lots of fun, even if you end up walking (waddling?) out with some of it in a bag.</description>

      <description>On Friday morning, 45 strangers sat down to work on this term&amp;#8217;s UCOSP projects. On Sunday, after three solid days of coding, talking, and learning, seven software development teams headed home. It was a long haul (especially for our visitors from the west coast and the Caribbean), but a lot of fun. I&amp;#8217;d like to thank everyone who took part, especially Alan Rosenthal, Carolyn Ursabia, Mike Conley, and Zuzel Vera Pacheco, who helped set everything up and run smoothly.</description>

      <description>A couple of students have asked how UCOSP projects are graded. The short answer is, you tell us. Seriously&amp;#8212;talk to your mentors and say, &amp;#8220;These are the things I want to tackle, here&amp;#8217;s why I think they&amp;#8217;d be valuable and how much effort they&amp;#8217;ll require, so please give me grades for X, Y, and Z.&amp;#8221; If your mentor thinks you&amp;#8217;ve chosen things that are too hard, too easy, or not particularly useful, the two of you can negotiate back and forth until you settle on something that makes you both happy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Greg, all the mentors/organisers and the nice people from IBM (especially Matthew) for everything they have done for us. They have obviously put lots of effort and their spare time into this and I think we should all give them a big round of aplause.
So.. the code sprint is now officially over.. and here is what I think..
What I liked:
 Having the chance to meet everyone before we actually start coding turns out to be extremely valuable.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8220;Do not waste time being jealous: sometimes you&amp;#8217;re ahead, sometimes behind. Race is long and in the end you see that you are only competing with yourself&amp;#8221;.

The reason I switched from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Science after my first undergrad year, to be short: it was extremely boring. I did not want to wait for the 3rd year to come in order for the stuff to get more interesting.</description>

      <description>The coding sprint is winding down here in Toronto, but the Mercurial UCOSP project is just getting into the groove. As people are making their way home &amp;#8211; across the street or across the country &amp;#8211; I want to take a few minutes to expand on Alex&amp;#8217;s post and summarize this weekend.
Working on a mature project like Mercurial has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, we have a real successful project to learn from, but at the same time, it is hard to find work that is both accessible to a newbie and has real impact on the project.</description>

      <description>What we did today:
 Assigned work to each team member, following the agile development style, we now have 10 small, measurable tickets here &amp;#8211; the goal of this sprint is to deliver 4 scenarios, and piloting graphical indicator for the next sprint. So we will have enough knowledge of the code in the team when the next sprint begins.  We have our first road blocker today &amp;#8211; the WMDServer does not work on either of our environments, whether it being Mac, Windows 7 or Windows Vista, and we have decided to work on the following items:</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s 2:30 pm on Sunday; a thick pallor persists over an unseasonably warm Toronto. For roughly 40 students from various Canadian and American universities, this marks the end of the UCOSP code sprint. Those of us working on Thunderbird have made progress on a number of bugs tagged with student-project:
 Zach Church is tackling Thunderbird&amp;#8217;s handling of recently closed tabs as reported here and here. Tim Miller is working on better integration with Windows 7 as reported here and here.</description>

      <description>This weekend, we focused on finding the main aspects of the program that we think need working on and deciding where to go with each one. Specifically, there was the simplification of toolbars and menus to cater to beginner programmers, comparing the Java versus Scheme parts of the project and approaching the open bugs that have already been identified. Also we experimented with the program from a first year student standpoint to determine what is and isn&amp;#8217;t necessary and went from there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve already met many of you in person, but I guess I should a bit about myself here too.
I&amp;#8217;m in my final term of my computer science degree at University of Waterloo and I&amp;#8217;m working on Mercurial this term.
At my last co-op job, I was feeling disheartened because the project I was working wouldn&amp;#8217;t have any impact on anything anyone would ever actually use. So, when I heard about UCOSP I was excited about the possibility of working on something real and useful for a change.</description>

      <description>Almost everyone who joins a new project says it sooner or later: &amp;#8220;More documentation, please.&amp;#8221; No one can make sense of 30,000 lines of code in one gulp: everyone wants an overview or roadmap to help them make sense of things. So why don&amp;#8217;t they exist?
 Almost by definition, by the time you can write that document, you don&amp;#8217;t need it yourself. You probably also have a dozen tickets assigned to you by then too, all of which really, really need to be fixed for next week&amp;#8217;s release.</description>

      <description>During this Code Sprint we focused on a few improvements to Mercurial that make it easier and safer to use. Each of the tasks we worked on was scoped such that only one developer was needed, but this gave everyone a chance to dive head-first into the Mercurial codebase at their own pace. For some (myself included) this is also the first serious project in Python, and these two days were a great opportunity to ask lots of questions.</description>

      <description>Hello!
So our project involves making Eclipse soft and fuzzy. So we are trying to hide 90% of Eclipse from the beginner programmer. Currently we are working on trying to hide menu commands and tool bar items in a non-random manner. The challenge is that we are not really creating new code (which there is tonnes of material about) but trying to find the sections of the Eclipse code that we need to modify or overrule and there&amp;#8217;s a lot of Eclipse code to sift through.</description>

No, not my blog &amp;#8212; I&amp;#8217;m not that modest &amp;#8212; but good words nonetheless :).
 And the post he cited included the lines:
 The kind of practice where all of a sudden I realize that it is 2am and I’m exhausted physically so I should go to bed, but mentally I feel on fire so I let the code have me for another hour or two (I imagine this state to be like a marathon runner or ironman near the end of their race).</description>

      <description>Hello everyone,
I&amp;#8217;m Jean (or John, as you like) and I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the Data Center Flight Simulator. I&amp;#8217;m a 4th year student in software engineering at Université Laval and that&amp;#8217;s my last semester, which is great!
Like several students here, that&amp;#8217;ll be my first experience in an open-source project and it&amp;#8217;ll certainly be a new challenge for me. The reason I&amp;#8217;m here is because I wanted to work on something different for my last school&amp;#8217;s project.</description>

Given that I&amp;#8217;m your instructor for both UCOSP and 376, I know there&amp;#8217;s a schedule conflict between the code sprint this weekend and Assignment 1 for 376, due Monday. I&amp;#8217;ll extend the A1 deadline for 376 students also participating in the code sprint: You have until Wednesday Jan 20 to turn in Assignment 1. That way you can focus single-mindedly on the sprint.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone !
My name is François Fournier ( call me frank, it&amp;#8217;s shorter and easier ! ). I will complete my formation in software engineering next fall. It will be my first contribution to an open-source project, all of my experience in software development came from classes or summer job.
Basie is a good project for me because it will help me to continue my learning of python.
I hope we will have fun during all this semester and I will see you all at Toronto this week-end.</description>

My name is Guillaume Simard ( pronounced &amp;#8216; Giiyom &amp;#8216; ), I&amp;#8217;m currently doing my last semester at Université Laval in Software Engineering ( sounds much better than &amp;#8216; Génie Logiciel &amp;#8216; .. ! ). These last four years, I&amp;#8217;ve worked mostly on web applications and video game development ( a hobby of mine ). I like using Python, which is part of why I chose Basie as my last project for my degree.</description>

      <description>Hi all! My name is Marcel Guzman and I&amp;#8217;m a 4th year student at SFU. My interests lie in online development of all kinds (from low-level networking to high-level web apps and everything in between!). I also enjoy esoteric languages as well as operating systems.
This semester, I&amp;#8217;ll be working on Thunderbird. I&amp;#8217;m very interested in Mozilla projects as well as learning how to code desktop apps so I think it will be a great fit for me.</description>

      <description>Hello.
My name is Denis. I&amp;#8217;m a third year computer science (AI) at the University of Toronto. I will be working with the Mercurial team.
I chose the Mercurial project because I didn&amp;#8217;t want to be involved in any academia-related projects, and I wanted to work on something with a large number of users. Also, C and python are my favourite languages, and it is sponsored by Fog Creek Software, which seems like a great company, so it would be nice to get on their good side.</description>

      <description>Hey Everyone!
My name is Chad Cogar and I&amp;#8217;m a fourth (fifth? :S) year student at the University of Toronto. My interests lie primarily in systems programming and artificial intelligence, and my experience stems mostly from personal projects (video game and mod development, various web projects) and coursework (CSC369: Operating Systems &amp;#8211; best CS course ever?). My favorite languages are C++ and Python, but I&amp;#8217;ve worked extensively with others as well.</description>

      <description>Titus Brown has started a wiki page describing what&amp;#8217;s expected from the Pony-Build students this term, and I just posted to the Basie blog about what we didn&amp;#8217;t finish last term, and need to get done in this one. In brief, Titus&amp;#8217;s points are:
 Communicate early and frequently. Make your work visible (if we can&amp;#8217;t see what you&amp;#8217;re doing, we can&amp;#8217;t help you). It&amp;#8217;s your responsibility to manage your time and make steady progress.</description>

 Joseph Mate  My name is Joseph. I am in 3B Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and will be working with MarkUs this term. I have not worked an open source project before; however, I am eager to start. I have lots of experience with Java from school and work. I have a little experience with C#, Python and Unix Shell Programming. I recently started playing around with Ruby and this term will be an excellent opportunity to extend what I already know.</description>

 the MXR search tool (comm-central here) to perform rgrep-style queries on the codebase. (A REST API here would be useful, I suspect&amp;#8230;) exuberant-ctags in vim, following setup 3 as described here. (Building the tag files takes roughly 15 minutes on my laptop.</description>

      <description>Hello Everyone,
My name is Fatima-Zohra Cherkaoui, I’m a junior (3rd year) from Minnesota State University, majoring in Software engineering. I will be working on the Pony-Build project for the upcoming semester.
I’m very excited to take part in this open-source project which will be for sure an inspiring learning experience.
So far, I have been using mostly C-related languages C++ and Java, but I have lately learned a functional language “Scala” (used in Twitter) and “Boo” (a Python-like language) which has given me the chance to broaden my view on programming from the traditional imperative style to the functional one.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m in my final term of a Bachelor of Computer Science. I&amp;#8217;ve learned from co-ops at Maplesoft, RIM, Amazon.com and Next Level Games, where I&amp;#8217;ve been a scriptor, a build monkey, a manual tester, a Java jockey, and a C++ centurion. I have no favourite language, because I can pick them up easily enough. I enjoy solving problems and learning new things.
I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the MarkUs Project this term from winter-laden Waterloo.</description>

I will be working on Thunderbird for the upcoming term. I am excited to be part of UCOSP and looking forward to my first open-source experience.
I&amp;#8217;m currently a senior at Michigan State University studying Computer Science. I already have a degree in Japanese language, and I have taken enough other classes that I could probably have minors in physics and economics too. I have worked at the university computer help desk fixing viruses and other problems for the last four years or so, but I am starting a new job this semester programming for one of the departments on campus.</description>

I am Brian Xu from SFU and currently experiencing my last year of undergraduate.
It feels really exciting when I received the admission mail to UCOSP. My latest projects experience are all related to web development such as leading a team to develop a website using Flex/PHP/MySQL, and working in HSBC for 8 months on website configuration and development. I am sure MarkUs is another great opportunity to broaden my knowledge about web development and also to learn from you genius!</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been enjoying programming ever since the first time I said &amp;#8220;hello world&amp;#8221; in C. Now my major languages are C-style ones such as Java and C#, and I&amp;#8217;m now working with ASP.net web development. I&amp;#8217;m eager to learn new technologies, and I believe it&amp;#8217;ll be a joy to shift to Ruby on Rails from my past experience.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, my name is Nikita Pchelin and this semester I will be working on Basie. Last semester I worked on ElmCity.
I am a 3rd year CS and French student, at the University of Toronto (Mississauga campus). I am really excited about taking this course – partly because if the programming challenges, but also because I want to experience working in a large team.
Working in a team where members live thousand miles away from each other is challenging; it forces the members to find new effective ways of interaction to get things done in time.</description>

      <description>Hi guys,
My name is Kefu Zhao and I am in the last year of my computing science Bachelor degree at SFU.
I finished an 8 month coop at HSBC, where I mainly used Java to implement some automation tools. Also, VBScript was also used to automate some regression test cases.
Then，I spent 4 month at IBM Victoria Lab, where JavaScript is the main language I used. Actually, I dealt with dojo web toolkit a lot and my tasks were to create customized widgets for IBM products.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Alexandru Totolici. I hail from UBC, starting the 6th winter term of my Bachelor of Science program (majoring in Computer Science). I&amp;#8217;ll be working on Mercurial. I&amp;#8217;ve been fortunate enough to work with some great people during co-ops at WebCT (now Blackboard), MDA, Safe Software, and Kodak, as well as during my time with UBC&amp;#8217;s Office of Learning Technology. I&amp;#8217;ve touched on QA, GUI, server API testing, backend tool development, WordPress and MediaWiki plugin development, and I&amp;#8217;ve done it in everything from Bash to C#.</description>

a while ago, Greg asked me to post something about why &amp;#8220;continuous integration&amp;#8221; was important and useful and awesome and absolutely critical and &amp;#8230; whatever else. I finally wrote that up and I am interested in your thoughts.
Note that the pony-build project (available this term!! as a UCOSP project!) is meant to address some of the deficiencies in the current CI options for (especially, but not limited to) Python projects.</description>

It has been awesome, one of the best choices I&amp;#8217;ve ever made. I just finished my degree requirements and am tying it all up by taking two more courses, doing this capstone project, and working on my startup, Matygo.</description>

      <description>A couple of people have emailed to ask why their university isn&amp;#8217;t included in the list of who&amp;#8217;s taking part in Winter 2010. The answer is that we haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find a faculty member willing to anchor things there, or that no students have stepped forward (usually because they&amp;#8217;re already in year-long capstone projects). All hope is not yet lost, though: we&amp;#8217;d be happy to hear from anyone who&amp;#8217;d like to join us, even at this late date.</description>

Admittedly, I have not had a fraction of the time that I thought I would have at the beginning of the semester, leaving me with a laundry list of work that still needs to be done on Ingres. For the entirety of this semester, it never ceased to amaze me how even though my class work load (projects, assignments, exams, etc.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: They way the students on the project came together and worked as a team, holding IRC meetings, sharing emails and conference calls.
Thumbs down: The project started off slower than expected, in part to the existing infrastructure and rules of interaction with Eclipse projects and with me becoming familiar with supervising such a unique student course experience.</description>

      <description>First off, thank you to Greg and all the profs and TAs that made this project course possible. It was definitely a unique and invaluable experience that I believe all students should consider in their undergraduate years.
What worked:
I&amp;#8217;ve been working full-time as a programmer for 3 years now and I wish I had taken this course during my undergrad as this course is extremely applicable to real life work practices.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not the first to say I learned a lot in this course, which was the point. The most obvious thing I learned was that group projects aren&amp;#8217;t what I expected. Believe it or not, this is my first real group project for school. Working in a team with meetings and dividing up the work according to who volunteers, and trying to figure out other people&amp;#8217;s aptitudes and parse their code and figure out what check-in comments were referring to was an experience.</description>

      <description>Positive: Finally, I can experience working on a real, fully distributed team. Also, I learn a lot of technical stuff from this course. From programming in python to machine learning algorithms. I am also grateful to learn from my colleagues as this is more practical than learning from textbooks.
Negative: I couldn&amp;#8217;t contribute to the team as much as I want to. There are various reasons for this but most notably is due to the complexity and difficulty of the project.</description>

Yulia + Ioana: Look into fixing coordinate system.
Chani: Will put together a skeleton of the document.
Patrik: Will write up an overview of the source code by Tuesday.
Alex: Plans to finish his passing improvements and contribute a write up of why we choose the python code.</description>

      <description>The Good:
It was nice to learn how people are using tools like FriendFeed to interact directly with their end-users. I know there are a lot of solutions to that specific problem, but my experience with large scale work in the past had only ever been internal projects.
The Bad:
Lack of direction. I understand that this wasn&amp;#8217;t really a problem for a lot of the projects, but I feel that ours suffered it in spades.</description>

      <description>Good
The code sprint. Hands down the most fun part of the course for me (as it was last year), I enjoyed meeting the smart people who make up the Basie team and solving a few key design problems. The Basie team came from all over, and it was a blast.
The Bad
Remote, remote, remote. I know that this business &amp;#8220;can be done from anywhere&amp;#8221;, but it&amp;#8217;s just not the same IMO.</description>

      <description>Whups, it appears I missed the original email on doing this writing assignment&amp;#8211;apologies for it being a bit late!
I&amp;#8217;ll start with my thoughts on the positives for this course first. I really feel I&amp;#8217;ve learned a great deal about working with a distance group on a software project&amp;#8211;something normal CS coursework doesn&amp;#8217;t really prepare one for (and even precious little time is spent in the courses I&amp;#8217;ve taken on working with more or less random groups as well).</description>

      <description>The good cent:
I would definitely say that the best part of my UCOSP experience has been my project &amp;#8220;mentor&amp;#8221;, Blake Winton. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how he put up with my incessant IRC messages at all times of the day Sunday through Saturday. I learned a lot about Mercurial and distributed version control from him, and he was always so chill that I couldn&amp;#8217;t help but want to work on the ISPDB.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: first of all, know a lot of new friends:) this is most valuable. Second, learn how to cooperation with each other, even we are far away from each other. We use IRC to hold and log team meeting, wiki page to schedule and record our process, bugzilla to keep track of everything. Those tools contribute a lot to the final success of the project. For the technical aspect, I learn the new language flex and use it to create the UI and animation for the front end.</description>

      <description>The Good: I learned a lot about web frameworks (specifically, Django) and jQuery applications from Basie. Without having any web development background, the course allowed me to move at my own pace while still absorbing lots of information that I will likely retain for future employment opportunities. Not only that, but the reference gained by doing such a project is certainly one of the best ways to get your foot in the door (here&amp;#8217;s looking at you, Greg ;)).</description>

      <description>thumbs up: Getting the opportunity to work with so many interacting technologies was a challenge. It forced me to take care with the documentation I have been preparing, and given me some inspiration as to ways that documentation could be organized better.
thumbs down: Meetings were often canceled and it was hard to set attainable personal goals.
All in all, I feel the course has been helpful. It was extremely frustrating at times because I felt like I was spending so much time dealing with installation problems and not always knowing what work was necessary to get to the next step.</description>

      <description>Up: One of the best parts for me was learning what a great thing constructive criticism is. I practically look forward to a denied patch because of the amount of feedback and the opportunity for improvement. This was refreshing after just getting a discouragingly low mark.
Down: The delay of email sometimes causes all progress to halt because I just didn&amp;#8217;t know how to proceed. This would cause breaks and dry spells, something I found tough to deal with.</description>

      <description>Good: I had a real good experience. It was a challenge still because we have not finished yet, but we learned how to solve problems that can apply to real world challenges in the computer science field. Talking with the Ingres community via email and IRC channel was real helpful.
Bad: We should communicate more often via UCOSP. We all work in separate ways with the Ingress community. We should do a written report every week to reinforce the meetings.</description>

      <description>Thumbs Up: Getting to work on an exploratory project, and seeing what it ended up becoming. WikiDev didn&amp;#8217;t have as defined a goal at the start as most projects, but instead a framework to build on and ideas for where we could take things. After that, it was up to everyone to discuss every week and see where we wanted to go next. This was very enlightening and I enjoyed seeing how the project evolved as pieces were completed and we could see what our ideas were shaping up to look like.</description>

      <description>Apart from the fact that it&amp;#8217;s great to work on a real project. I believe it was invaluable to meet the programmer behind the name at the start of semester. It gave us the chance to not only meet, but perform a little team building as well rather than just a name somewhere in cyberspace. I think that working in a distributed team like this gave us all an experience that we might not get from some IT companies.</description>

      <description>The Good: I, for one, really loved the grad school talk, I think that it was very insightful and I&amp;#8217;m really glad that we got the opportunity to attend it.
The Bad: Can&amp;#8217;t do pair programming when team members are 500km away 🙁 This might be a personal preference but I&amp;#8217;m a huge fan of pair programming, I find development a lot smoother and it&amp;#8217;s also easy to stay motivated and on track.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: Mozilla&amp;#8217;s strict coding standards and having to submit patches and get our code reviewed was very beneficial. It forces you to pay attention to details and you learn a lot more compared to projects that you hack together last minute and hand in whatever works 🙂
Thumbs down: The tasks our team worked on were pretty individual and so there wasn&amp;#8217;t much collaboration between us.</description>

      <description>[disclaimer: my own opinion, others might not think the same]
The good: the course itself, was a great experience. I think the most valuable thing is that it made me see the challenges software teams face in the real world and why those challenges can&amp;#8217;t be resolved easily sometimes. In addition, I got a chance to work on a great project, and this is the reason I took this course in the first place.</description>

      <description>The official goal of this course is to give students first-hand experience of working in distributed teams. There are lots of other lessons to be learned, though, lessons that can only be learned by working on real applications. Take the performance bug that we just found in Basie, or the seemingly-simple problem of deleting tags (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). Neither is a coding bug: in both cases, we&amp;#8217;re going to have to re-think a significant chunk of the system&amp;#8217;s design.</description>

      <description>+1: Collaboration. When the team first started on the project we each worked on bugs that were, for the most part, independent of each other. At around the mid-point of the term, we decided to collaborate more and work on smaller features of a bigger part. This way we were all working toward a common goal. I think we all enjoyed the project much more after we made this decision.</description>

      <description>The good: Quite unequivocally, the students. Each member of the team was eager to learn whatever new language we threw at them (PHP, SQL, Flex/MXML/ActionScript), research solutions to overcome problems they encountered, and ask for assistance when needed. With so many variables in this type of distributed course, including the different experiences and skill sets that comes with being from four separate institutions, having a strong team makes quite a difference.</description>

      <description>Peter Status  Good push to finished work on bug 294015. Decided to use the &amp;ldquo;empty project&amp;rdquo; wizard and the already created Kawa File wizard so that now they can be used to create a project and scheme files. Fixing NULL pointer exception when clicking a file in the explorer. I am pretty sure that it has to do with the fact that I used the Java Lite Explorer and it is looking for the java lite editor which doesn&amp;#8217;t exist in Scheme.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up:
 A chance to make a name on a open source project (&amp;#8220;eclipse&amp;#8221;) The formation that Wayne gave us during the code sprint, We would definitly not have acomplished as much without it. Regular project conference call with the team and Dwight. We managed to work as a real team and set-up a svn and irc channel and have 2 irc meeting each week to give each other a status update.</description>

      <description>I worked on RoboCup and I have to say it didn&amp;#8217;t turn out to be what I expected in the beginning. But I really enjoyed it despite the problems we had (just like any other team this term).
There isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot of bad things I can say about the csc494 experience. We pretty much lost that month before the Code Sprint because we couldn&amp;#8217;t get an access to the repository.</description>

      <description>We had our meeting on Sunday, November 22. Here is what the team had been up to:
Alex
&amp;#8211; worked on passing, now it takes into account players from the opposit team
&amp;#8211; it is hard to make 100% accurate passing because of the noise added to the measurements
Next task:
&amp;#8211; work on interception as it is related to passing
Chani
&amp;#8211; fixed code so that now players are using data from the current tick</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: Learning skills and applying them to complete daily project tasks. Like the old saying goes, its like killing two birds with one stone, learning all these new technical/non technical skills that will look pretty good in a resume and completing a great project and getting credits for it, hence making progress in terms of school credits. This was a very rewarding experience, with a great team, if it was not for other school commitments I would do it again</description>

      <description>Can&amp;#8217;t believe this is coming to an end already. I&amp;#8217;ve read it before, but let it be the best experience of my undergraduate career too. 🙂
Con : Setting-up
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just about me (but I don&amp;#8217;t think so), and I know that MarkUs was, by far, not the worst project for that concern, but I didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy the set-up time. One could argue that I never do. One would be right.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: Great experience working as part of a geographically dispersed team. In all my co-op terms, I&amp;#8217;ve always worked in an office where I could talk to people face-to-face. Now that my experience has broadened, I expect to be a better team player on future software development projects.
Thumbs down: Sporadic time commitments. As a student with 4 other courses, contributing 8-10 hours a week means working sporadically throughout the week when time permits for 1-3 hour chunks at a time.</description>

      <description>Greg:
You are not allowed to repeat something that someone else has said (which is a good incentive to post early :-).
 Apparently posting within the day isn&amp;#8217;t early enough; there are almost two pages already.
I&amp;#8217;d like to echo what Josh said, both the good and the bad. The best courses in my undergraduate have been the ones where I&amp;#8217;ve done &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; work, and the more opportunities I have to do such things the better.</description>

      <description>Being a part of the Robocup UCOSP project has been an interesting experience.
First, I&amp;#8217;ll discusses some of the issues with this project. It&amp;#8217;s not actually an open source project, and it&amp;#8217;s not really under development by anyone other then my group members. This is an issue because we didn&amp;#8217;t really get to experience that side of an open source project (ie. being part of a larger picture and lending a hand).</description>

      <description>the good: Working with a good team. We&amp;#8217;ve all had those projects where half the team is asleep or incapable of communicating or just doesn&amp;#8217;t do their work. This was one of those rare group projects where I got to be in a group of students who *wanted* to be there. it&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;m more used to in the free software world but not in school.
the bad: The chaos. Having our team drop to 5 people threw off a lot of the plans we&amp;#8217;d made at the sprint.</description>

      <description>I have really enjoyed working on MarkUs this semester!
One of the things I liked the best was that our TA and one of the students on our team had both already worked on our project before and they knew both MarkUs and Ruby on Rails inside and out. I think that everyone on the team benefited from their past experiences and it was great to be able to get advice from them and ask them questions throughout the semester.</description>

      <description>I think that this course was a great way to finish off my undergraduate computer science career. I am working on the MarkUs project.
One of the things that I really like about MarkUs is that we have students working on developing a system that students will use to submit assignments. I really wish that we could use a similar methodology to develop a new course registration system (similar to the functionality that PeopleSoft&amp;#8217;s QUEST currently provides for us) and an online course system (similar to ANGEL or WebCT).</description>

      <title>good and the bad</title>

      <description>Overall I really enjoyed this course. The one bad thing is that a lot was opened ended. This can be a good thing, however I things like have 2 deliverable dates throughout the semester so we know what we have to accomplish by these dates. Also, making code reviews a requirement and having to turn in a list of goals to accomplish by the end of the code sprint instead of half way through the semester.</description>

      <description>I guess since everyone else started with the goods and finished with the bads. I&amp;#8217;ll go in reverse, leave a better taste in your mouth.
I definitely disliked the fact that I was the only one not in the Eastern time zone, it made it hard for us to get together(virtually). I also found it difficult to chat with the team. By the time I was finished my classes, it was already way late in the Eastern area.</description>

      <description>Up : The great start we had during the code sprint. Wayne Beaton and Dwight Deugo took their time to travel to Toronto and to explain us some really useful concepts and tools. Without them, the team would have started later.
Down : The lack of review from our supervisors. I know that they have a lot to do and that they can&amp;#8217;t hold our hands, but it would have been nice to know if our last submit was good/ok/bad and the reason why they think so.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: I think code reviews really helped keep everyone on track and to maintain high standards. Mike did a great job reading and commenting on the reviews. It turned out to be a good form of communication between meetings.
Thumbs not so up: As a supervisor, I just couldn&amp;#8217;t keep up, so it was hard to help steer the progress.
Thumbs down: This is a hard format for a postmortem.</description>

      <description>ThumbUp: Having meetings every week and posting status reports helped keep us on track.
ThumbDown: I think it would be good to have more variety in projects, in particular some that are less development-oriented and involve more research</description>

      <description>ThumbUp: peer reviews. Peer reviews, at least for the Basie team, was certainly a new type of experience in software development. It promoted communication between the team, getting into each other&amp;#8217;s code, writing code that is good enough for others to look at, and then still getting feedback on how to improve it. It creates a better &amp;#8220;team&amp;#8221; feeling, than simply having a group of people commit to the same source code repository.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: The code sprint where all students and participating parties gathering face to face provides a precious opportunity for them to know each other, especially on each others&amp;#8217; working style, which helped a lot during the course later on.
Thumbs down: Difference between schools&amp;#8217; expectation from students leads to a significant difference in students&amp;#8217; motivation. If the students are grouped into sub teams working on the same smaller project, we should weight more on continuous communication.</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: Sponsors, I liked the fact that we were able to get further acquainted with large businesses in the computer science field such as Ingres, Tucows, Yahoo, and Rogers Communication. I also agree with Greg&amp;#8217;s point, and it was a good learning experience to work on projects in a different setting and environment.
Thumbs down: Though this may have been expensive, I would&amp;#8217;ve liked to have a UCOSP meeting like the initial sprint at the end of this experience to wrap up the project.</description>

      <description>I am impressed with how much was accomplished in the end. I must say that it is not more than I what was planning/hoping for but at the same time, throughout the course, I had this nagging feeling that things will not come together, and, in the end, we wouldn&amp;#8217;t have anything &amp;#8220;complete&amp;#8221; to show for it. Well we do, and that&amp;#8217;s great!
In spite of notes and discussions and todos and tickets, we still managed to do a few things multiple times (stepping on each other&amp;#8217;s toes).</description>

      <description>Thumbs up: Our great teamwork. Although we are working in a distributed setting, I do find it astonishing how well everything worked out. People are doing a great job in terms of communication.
Thumbs down: Having a pretty tight schedule, I think there was hardly time for one or two developers to go for a spike (i.e. looking into an unknown technological area) and create an example solution to a problem.</description>

      <description>Following up on Greg Wilson&amp;#8217;s post, here&amp;#8217;s another pair of observations about the course; one good and one bad:
Thumbs up: Gaining experience working in a distributed environment is invaluable, but when you add on top of that the fact that we are producing some great open source software, you have a winning combination. Some of us have experience in the industry through co-op and other programs at our universities, but at least for me working on open source was a completely different experience.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re coming up on the end of term, so it&amp;#8217;s time to start thinking about what went right and what went wrong. I&amp;#8217;ve asked the students and mentors to post their ideas here, but to lead off:
Thumbs up: our broad geographic range. I was really pleased to have schools from three oceans (four if you count the Great Lakes) take part.
Thumbs down: most projects weren&amp;#8217;t ready to roll on day one.</description>

      <description>The minutes themselves are available here.
This week we tried to figure out what we&amp;#8217;ll try to have done for our deadline next week. The list we obtained by the end of the meeting was as follows:
 Hooking up the dev database. Having all the external libraries situated under a single directory. Supporting more TABULAR sites. Supporting a few CALENDAR sites. Hooking up pluginFinder to the generic plugins. Supporting a query on a single url that tells you two things: if it&amp;#8217;s parsable, and which plugin handles the parsing.</description>

      <description>MarkUs is an open-source tool which recreates the ease and flexibility of grading assignments with pen on paper, within a web application. It also allows students and instructors to form groups, and collaborate on assignments. MarkUs is implemented in Ruby on Rails, and every line of code has been written by undergraduate students. It is currently used in 3 classes at the University of Toronto. There are plans to use it for one course in Waterloo starting in January with the hopes of expanding our user base in the Fall of 2010.</description>

      <description>As the end of the semester closes in on us students, we will be piecing together or documentation from tweets, blogs, and the like. My project has allowed for many opportunities to actually edit the wiki pages on the Ingres site. While this is probably the most direct way to contribute to the community I have been working with, it ignores a subtle strength we have as new-comers to the projects we are working on: inexperience.</description>

      <description>Here are three suggestions for improving UCOSP next term [1]; comments would be very welcome.
 Have every mentoring project put together a list of 1 small task per week per student for the first four weeks of the project. The goal is to make sure that the mentors and the students are more organized and on the same page by the time the main work in the project starts. It will also serve as a weeding out period: students who can&amp;#8217;t get four small tasks done are unlikely to be able to hack the rest of the course.</description>

      <description>As they just announced on their blog, I&amp;#8217;ll be speaking at CUSEC 2010 in Montreal in January on evidence-based software engineering (which is a lot more fun than you&amp;#8217;d guess from the title). Hope to see some of you there.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it is hard to recognize when a problem can be best solved by starting over. Over the past few days I have been making a lot of configurations on Windows using something called &amp;#8216;Windows Configuration-By-Forms&amp;#8217;. You can start it by going to the command prompt(typing &amp;#8220;cmd&amp;#8221; in Start-&amp;gt;Run) and typing the command &amp;#8220;cbf&amp;#8221;.
Well, after all was said and done I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to load php pages consistently. I previously was able to connect to an Ingres database, but not return any successful queries.</description>

      <description>The objective of the team project is to develop a 3d visualization in Sun&amp;#8217;s Wonderland. The team will be given access to a WikiDev2.0 project with a set of data on multiple versions of a project developed collaboratively by a small team. The WikiDev repository includes data about classes their metrics and the relations among them. The task will be to implement 3D models and appropriate interactions for users to explore the data in WL, using a city metaphor, as discussed in the paper &amp;#8220;A 3D Metaphor for Software Production Visualization&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; see http://ieeexplore.</description>

      <description>Lately, I stumbled upon this interesting article of a former Debian project lead. He opens with this:
 A lot of people seem to think that open source is a magic solution to project management and that open source projects will automatically attract a large and healthy community of contributors and users who will improve the software. This, of course, is not the case.
 How can people believe that open source projects are automatically a success?</description>

      <description>Basie is a web-based software project forge that integrates revision control, issue tracking, mailing lists, wikis, status dashboards, and other tools that developers need to work effectively in teams. It is simple enough for students to master in just a few minutes, but powerful enough to support large, distributed teams, and is freely distributed under an open source license.
Basie is built on top of Django, a Python-based web application framework, and the jQuery Javascript library.</description>

      <description>The Geospatial Information System industry is over $4B in size and growing rapidly. Perhaps more interesting is that geospatial (think maps) technology is being integrated into mainstream technology. For example, how may people have not used Google Maps or a GPS at some point? Technology change has made what was impossible a decade ago not only possible, but perhaps practical for firms that could not use geospatial technology in the past.</description>

      <description>The Mercurial distributed version control system is used by thousands of developers. NetBeans, OpenJDK, OpenOffice, and Python itself are just a few of the projects that have adopted Mercurial as their version control system. But as much as Mercurial has been making incredible inroads in the open-source community, it has some key deficiencies that make it a poor choice for real-life commercial development.
Here at Fog Creek Software, we&amp;#8217;re about to release a brand-new source control management system called Kiln that&amp;#8217;s based on Mercurial.</description>

      <description>Pony-build is a simple system for gathering, managing, displaying, and integrating build and test results. It consists of two core components: a server (for gathering and managing results) and a client library for describing build and test processes.
The project goals are pretty open, but we&amp;#8217;d like to enable features like &amp;#8220;phoning home&amp;#8221; from tests run during installation; integration with test-running frameworks; upload and storage of binary &amp;#8220;-latest&amp;#8221; packages; inclusion and display of code coverage; &amp;#8220;test swarms&amp;#8221; and a leaderboard for the Python community; integration with the Python Package Index; and configurable PubSubHubbub-based &amp;#8220;push&amp;#8221; notification of build events.</description>

      <description>One of the major long term goals for the Technology Explorer for IBM DB2 has been to provide an environment similar to a flight simulator for Database Administrators. Pilots used to learn to deal with potentially dangerous and stressful situations in a real plane. This was risky and expensive. Pilots today learn to deal with system failures and extreme conditions on flight simulators. DBAs still develop their experience on live multi-million dollar production systems.</description>

      <description>The Eclipse IDE for Education (IDE4EDU) is a version of Eclipse streamlined specifically for use by university and college students. The environment provides support for programming languages that are commonly used in university courses, including Java, Scheme, and Prolog.
Our initial efforts were focused on providing a Java environment with reduced clutter that allows students to focus on their immediate requirement of getting classroom work done. This version provided a streamlined environment featuring stripped down versions of wizards for creating common elements.</description>

Status:
+documenting and testing remote.py, batch.py (this leaves us with no &amp;#8220;big&amp;#8221; modules untested, rotate.py and event.py can
be done quickly later on).
 timezone had to be revisited and changed a bit (timezone_source, timezone_dest), and together with other little things   we officially announced the new features to the community
Roadblocks:
&amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve been sick for the past couple of days, so things are moving a bit slower for me than usual.</description>

A grading scheme is the academic equivalent of a contract of deliverables: it&amp;#8217;s the thing that you and I can put in front of a judge or some other third part if we disagree over whether you&amp;#8217;ve delivered what I thought was promised.</description>

      <description>Maxime Caron recently posted results from the French version of our survey. Here are some of the findings from the English version and how I interpret them. (Note: Unfortunately, the server that was hosting the survey had a slight meltdown (literally!). We were able to recover some data but not everything.)
The first five questions were used to gain an understanding of the user and their previous programming experience. This allowed us to interpret the results in the proper context.</description>

      <description>On Friday, the Elmcity team had its weekly meeting, the minutes of which can be found here.
A summary of the things we covered:
We went over and finalized our grading scheme, including exactly what functionality we hope to have achieved by the 29th of November.
In that vein, we&amp;#8217;ve decided that our functionality will primarily be dictated by the ability to parse the pages brought up by our users here, and secondarily by this list.</description>

      <description>Mark Breakdown
1. Individual (50%)
a) 40% &amp;#8211; participation:
 20% code contributions 10% discussions on friendfeed and google code wiki throughout the term 10% weekly punchlines and how they were met (trackable through the &amp;#8220;status&amp;#8221; portion)  b) 10% &amp;#8211; written component
2. Team (50%)
a) 30% Features and Functionality:
 all the existing functionality up-to-date (plugins, events filtering, timezones management) still works as expected (test don&amp;#8217;t fail), existing bookmarks on delicious produce valid iCal feeds generalized parser that can at least recognize a minimum set of information for the event (date &amp;amp; time, title, and a link) on each of the pages listed here.</description>

      <description>I just compiled the results from the survey i did about Integrated Development Environment for the Eclipse4Edu project.
The survey was first set-up by Dennis Acosta but i did a french version of the form. These results contain only the feedback from Sherbrooke university students for now.
Surprisingly more people use the debugger and refactoring features then i would have thought. Also most people said they would not use their built-in ide tutorials.</description>

      <description>The Basie team had its meeting yesterday (chat log). The main topic of this week&amp;#8217;s meeting was coming up with a marking rubric for the UCOSP students.
We spent some time going over one of the papers mentioned earlier &amp;#8211; Turning Student Groups into Effective Teams (PDF) &amp;#8211; focusing on the fourth section on peer ratings. Everyone seemed to agree with the second approach detailed on page 9 of the PDF (page 17 in the journal).</description>

&amp;#8211; 25% for the actual deliverables. Based on how much were we able to implement as a team and the quality of our code/product. Each student will receive the same grade. We will attempt the &amp;#8220;5-minute screencast on YouTube&amp;#8221; if time permits.</description>

Descriptions  Course Participation. Participation as marked by Greg for things like posting to the blog, responding to comments, attending code sprints, etc.  Rationale: This is an online, collaborative course. General communication certainly plays a part, and is integral to being a contributing member of the online community. It should not weigh too much, however; as a course, the focus must be on getting real work done.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s nothing like a bit of controversy to push up readership&amp;#8212;and blood pressure. I inadvertently started it by describing UCOSP to Joel Spolsky at DevDays in Toronto last Friday. He thought that having undergrads work on capstone projects in distributed teams was cool&amp;#8212;cool enough that he&amp;#8217;s willing to sponsor the program and have one of his employees mentor a Mercurial project next term.
Browsing our blog, he came across my post &amp;#8220;A Rational Response to an Irrational Environment&amp;#8220;.</description>

      <description>Communications of the ACM has published a reflective article by Sir Tony Hoare in which he looks back forty years to one of the foundational articles in computer science. It includes a lot of interesting snippets, including this:
 The phenomenon that triggered interest in software verification from the software industry was totally unpredicted and unpredictable. It was the attack of the hacker&amp;#8230;

 Joel Spolsky has blogged about UCOSP. He&amp;#8217;s going to help sponsor us next term, and one of his employees will lead a Mercurial project. Being mentioned in &amp;#8220;Joel on Software&amp;#8221; has a noticeable impact on readership figures:  </description>

      <title>Yak-shaving: Investing in technology, or just self-distraction?</title>

      <description>[I sent this post to the mailing list last week. Greg suggested I re-post it here, where it would last longer than on the mailing list.]
In his discussion of &amp;#8220;yak-shaving&amp;#8221;, Greg wrote: &amp;#8220;you very quickly lose sight of your original goal and wind up investing way too much time in things that aren&amp;#8217;t directly delivering value.&amp;#8221;
True, but bear in mind that the whole notion of &amp;#8220;investment&amp;#8221; is spending resources on something that does not directly deliver present value, with the expectation of future value.</description>

      <description>By the end of this week (Oct 30), each of our teams has to propose a grading scheme they&amp;#8217;d like used for their term&amp;#8217;s work. To do this, they&amp;#8217;ll have to decide (a) what they&amp;#8217;re going to deliver by Friday December 4 (our target wrap-up date) and (b) how much of their grade will depend on the team&amp;#8217;s accomplishments, and how much will depend on individual contributions. Experience shows that the latter is much harder to decide than the former: most people want their grade to reflect what they&amp;#8217;ve done, but clients care about what&amp;#8217;s delivered as a whole.</description>

      <description>My QA teacher recently pointed us to the following interesting paper. It describes a process framework for development in a distributed (optionally open-source) context. They call it Community-Agile software guidance.
Though no single process framework can apply to every projects, you&amp;#8217;ll find that many recommendations in that paper are nowadays must-follow rules (those regarding quality in particular). I also like the way the author presents growing software as compared to a living creature that ought to be surrounded by an appropriate community in order to fully blossom and how that software needs to be guided toward maturity as it grows.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a list of tools I cast essential for carrying out my day-to-day business or I find otherwise useful.
Hardware (in no particular order)**
**
 My primary workstation is a HP Pavillion Slimline, a pretty much standard, off-the-shelf PC on which I installed Ubuntu Linux. The hardware works reasonable well under Linux, but at some point I wish hardware vendors would just offer some models which work seamlessly with any major OS.</description>

Minutes by: Maciej
&amp;#8211; Discsussed difference between having a different perspective for each programming language and having everything in one tab.
-&amp;gt; Note: Scheme users will generally be more advanced than Java users (might already be familiar with perspectives)
-&amp;gt; Easier to have different perspectives.
&amp;#8211; Considered Debuggers for Java and Scheme
-&amp;gt; Do we want a debugger intergrated into the Java perspective?

 Just finished building a test suite for the xmi parser. See the testing plan for an overview of how it works. The main body of the code lives in xmi parser/src/testsuite/testsuite.sh. Roadblocks   Looking to the future, I&amp;#8217;m not sure how to get ramped up on what Bolthale is doing &amp;#8211; when the parser is done Team Waterloo is supposed to switch to helping him out.</description>

Status:
&amp;#8211; The project I was working on got canned, so I&amp;#8217;m trying to get reacquainted with the core codebase
&amp;#8211; Also trying to understand the intended goals and power structure of this project better so I don&amp;#8217;t waste more work. This entails some discussion, new use of the bug tracking system for laying out goals, and group formulation of user stories (to be finished at this Friday&amp;#8217;s meeting)</description>

Status:
&amp;#8211; Tried to tweak to Java client to produce data file for Decision Tree. However, it was cancelled since we might not need it due to Yulia&amp;#8217;s work to parse server log file.
&amp;#8211; Training a goalie with the human controller to produce a convincing data file.
Next tasks:
&amp;#8211; Testing Yulia&amp;#8217;s log parser.
&amp;#8211; Finding the right parameters to build Decision Tree.
Roadblocks:
&amp;#8211; It is very difficult to get a high-quality of training data for building a good Decision Tree.</description>

      <description>Four years ago, I asked one of the best students I&amp;#8217;ve ever had why she always did her projects in one big burst of activity starting at the last possible minute. She explained to me that (a) she was more productive if she focused on one thing at a time, rather than trying to timeslice on three or four assignments at once, and (b) the later she left it, the more stable the assignment spec would be, because the keeners that started early would have pestered the prof into correcting the inevitable omissions, ambiguities, and what-not.</description>

      <description>Over the last four or five years, there&amp;#8217;s been a dramatic increase in the number of books about programming: not the specifics of this language or that framework, but the act of programming itself. Fogel&amp;#8217;s Producing Open Source Software, Spinellis&amp;#8217;s Code Reading, Ford&amp;#8217;s The Productive Programmer, Doar&amp;#8217;s Practical Development Environments, and multi-author collections like Beautiful Code and Beautiful Testing all discuss the things that separate people who can write code that compiles and runs from people who can build useful software.</description>

      <description>We resumed our regular meeting time today and the IRC log is at http://hypatia.cs.ualberta.ca/ucosp/index.php/UCOSP_IRC:Tue_Oct_13_2009. We have a plan for what will be done by the end of the month and we are making good progress (fingers crossed) towards it.
The interesting aspects of this week&amp;#8217;s and last week&amp;#8217;s discussion have been, in my view (and I welcome my team members to clarify refine and completely revise it), that
 you need a specific scenario to figure out the details where the you-know-who hides, and pictures are worth a lot of words,  Also I am happy that we have subteams, especially the two pairs.</description>

      <description>Recently I attempted to describe what kind of process we used while developing Basie. My first shot at the definition was a little off, but it turns out that there is no clear definition for how we do things. I&amp;#8217;m looking for some feedback from fellow students on what they think of our current process and how they would go about defining it. I&amp;#8217;m planning on coming up with another revision of this definition once I hear what others have to say.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been an interesting week for blog posts:
 The folks at Scout just threw away three months of development work, and improved their product by doing. The takeaway lesson is that you should continually ask yourself, &amp;#8220;Is the thing I&amp;#8217;m writing essential to satisfying the pressing needs of a particular user?&amp;#8221; If the answer is no, put it aside and work on something that is. Martin Fowler (author of Refactoring and many other must-read books) has an interesting post about technical debt; David Humphrey has an equally interesting reply.</description>

      <description>The further I go in my computing education, the more entertaining I find it to look back on previous assignments and projects that I have worked on. It&amp;#8217;s entertaining because the code that I wrote as a first year, is in my opinion terrible. It&amp;#8217;s not only the fact that my code was terribly inefficient, it&amp;#8217;s the fact that I have no clue what I was doing at all. I say to myself wow!</description>

      <description>The WikiDev team met on Tuesday after Thanksgiving and the IRC log is at http://hypatia.cs.ualberta.ca/ucosp/index.php/UCOSP_IRC:Tue_Oct_13_2009. All in all, everyone is making progress, we just addressed an interesting messy issue regarding IDs, and we have no major roadblocks (albeit there are several interesting technical complexities we have to address). The required student reports are forthcoming, later today.</description>

 We don&amp;#8217;t have any unit or integration tests, so it&amp;#8217;s impossible to be completely reassured with code changes.  Next Steps:

      <description>On the Basie blog I recently made a post about the jQuery UI Themeroller tool and why it&amp;#8217;s useful. One of my purposes for making the post was to draw some input about the current color theme in Basie. As developers we don&amp;#8217;t have to make these types of decisions every day, but it&amp;#8217;s still quite an important one. At the very least take a look and learn a bit about jQuery UI, you might find it useful some day down the road!</description>

In short, I think I&amp;#8217;m a pretty able communicator; but if that&amp;#8217;s the case, then why has it been so hard to communicate within my own team, and with the rest of you.</description>

      <description>First Patch Ever.
Once my pending patch has been checked into the source tree, I will become a member of the open source community. It doesn&amp;#8217;t look like much but it does fix a problem. I take heart from Richard Feynman who said, &amp;#8221; No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.&amp;#8221;. Here is a few things I learned:
 Svn needs a better way to manage patches because pending ones causes a mess.</description>

      <description>One of the reasons I&amp;#8217;m interested in the Eclipse4Edu project is that it is heavily based on user experience. The goal is to create a streamlined IDE for beginners so that they can immediately focus on learning the language and concepts instead of struggling with an environment. Eventually, a novice can move to a classic Eclipse environment while maintaining a sense of familiarity.
One could argue that a beginner could start with the standard Eclipse environment and just ignore the &amp;#8216;advanced&amp;#8217; features.</description>

      <description>My team has been using Mercurial as our version control system, and it is definitely pretty cool.
We have run into some interesting &amp;#8220;problems&amp;#8221; though. Since the main Thunderbird repository is subversion, and we don&amp;#8217;t have commit access, we have to submit patches that are reviewed and then committed. The real problem comes with branching, merging, and committing.
Long story made short (or the moral of the story) is that newbies shouldn&amp;#8217;t push/pull Mercurial repos from each other.</description>

Meanwhile, Farah Juma has been posting ideas for grade entry in MarkUs, and would probably also like to know your thoughts. Next time you&amp;#8217;re tired of staring at your linear algebra assignment, take a moment to give them some feedback, or post a question of your own here (or on your project&amp;#8217;s blog, with a link from here).</description>

      <description>Morning everyone,
I just wrote a post over at the Basie blog about what type of information people would find useful on Basie&amp;#8217;s new dashboard.
I&amp;#8217;m hoping to try and gather as much user input on the matter as possible so your participation would be greatly appreciated.
Stay gold,

      <description>We had our first meeting after the code sprint today. The main points from the meeting are that, the three subteams should develop a wiki page describing the incremental tests they want to accomplish with an initial deadline of October 7, 2009. These tests will be evolving over time as the teams accomplish their different tasks. Another major point was to create tickets for any non trivial changes required and how a single ticket can be assigned to multiple people.</description>

      <description>Following our wonderful progress during the code-sprint, the results of which can be seen here, we&amp;#8217;ve tried to regroup and set forth a list of goals we can achieve by the end of the semester.
For our FuseCal replacement, we hope to make it a really robust service with even more bells and whistles than FuseCal had. Here is the list of goals we came up with on Sunday, and the discussion on who wants to tackle which parts.</description>

      <description>Better late then never!
Day 3 was more productive than I expected it to be.
 Alex and myself continued researching a third party monitor which provides extra information. Yulia and Patrik have been working on a script to allow someone to easily control a player, through the keyboard. Chani and Ioana have been working on a debugging tool.  We ended the day with a quick meeting to decide how our teams will split up.</description>

      <description>Like the first two days of the code sprint, yesterday was a very productive day for the MarkUs team. Review Board continued to receive a workout as review requests kept coming in. We also had a meeting in the afternoon to discuss our tasks for the rest of the semester. You&amp;#8217;ll want to check out the exciting new features that we are planning on adding to MarkUs!</description>

      <description>&amp;#8230;but we did one anyway, since the code sprint marks the end of the startup phase of our projects.
Good:
 the code sprint was held early in term everyone got to the sprint, and got a much clearer idea of what their project is about effective initial training (for some projects) good collaboration a chance to learn how to use version control and other professional tools for real the talk about grad school was informative good workspace for the sprint, and the network ran flawlessly enjoyed pub night(s) 🙂  Bad:</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve wrapped up our Fall 2009 code sprint, and I think a bit of self-congratulation is in order: things went very well. I&amp;#8217;d like to thank all the students for giving three good days, and everyone else who made it possible&amp;#8212;in no particular order:
 Wayne Beaton (Eclipse Foundation) Steven Case (University of the Virgin Islands) Dwight Deugo (Carleton University) Karen Reid (University of Toronto) Andrew Ross (Ingres) Blake Winton (Thunderbird) Rick Yazwinski and Jody Stocks (TUCOWS) Mike Conley, Phil Patchin, Michael Reimer, and Zuzel Vera Pacheco (University of Toronto grad students)  Special thanks to Alan Rosenthal for setting up our computers and networks&amp;#8212;everything ran perfectly all weekend long&amp;#8212;and to our sponsors: Ingres, the Open Source Lab, Rogers, TUCOWS, and Yahoo!</description>

      <description>For day 3 of the code sprint weekend the ECLIPSE4EDU team worked mainly on planning possible bugs or features.  We had brainstorming for new features that we think might be interesting and came up with 5 new feature we all think must be done.  We also talked about the grading scheme we wanted and realised this project is kind of hard# to evaluate and that the crucial thing to focus on is the community process and communication.</description>

      <description>Today, Eric and I (Owen) continued working together to modify the XMI parser to work for the eUML2 format. We were able to successfully parse a simple UML diagram with properties and inheritance.
Botlhale continued learning PHP and how to connect to a database with it. He also worked on how to generate an XML file from existing data in a database.
Holy and Alex continue digging into the way of visualization the Diagram.</description>

      <description>…and the sun is setting on day 2 of the code sprint. Today we were able to combine the two plugins together and get a working front-end. Each of the plugins each returna list of events that is returned to the front end. Here is the link for the front end: http://elmcity.cs.toronto.edu/ As of now, we have only handled the two urls shown in the examples. It only intelligent enough to handle those two.</description>

      <description>This morning we got right into coding. Nil and I(Peter) started working on bug 250659 a feature to have assignments created in XML and displayed to students via an Assignment/Reference view. Maxime and Maciej worked on the eclipse code completetion, the ability for the code completetion window to actually stay open if you make a typo. Dennis lost the rock paper scissors match and was coding solo today, he was working at removing items from the editor context menu.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;#8217;ve written earlier, an increasing amount of research in software engineering is focused on empirical studies of what actually works (or doesn&amp;#8217;t) in the real world. A new paper from Moe, Dingsøyr, and Dybå reports a multi-year study of teams in several companies implementing Scrum. Key problems they identified include:
 Over-specialization: if each module &amp;#8220;belongs&amp;#8221; to one developer, it&amp;#8217;s hard for the group as a whole to design and plan, because no one knows enough to get a big picture view.</description>

      <description>The Robocup team had their first in-person meeting yesterday. For the first couple of hours, we played around with some of the clients developed by the students who worked on this project over the summer. Then, we had a meeting with Steve Engles, where we decided on the language an code base we want to use. We decided to go with one of the Python clients, because the Java one was using a lot of third-party code and we felt that we wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to improve on it from the beginning, and the other Python client was too basic.</description>

      <description>As the first day draws to a close, the elmcity crew is putting the finishing touches on our project skeleton. A very productive day has been had by all, most of us were a little unsure about how to even begin when the day started, but by now everyone has assigned themselves a part of the project. We’re essentially re-creating the backend of the defunct FuseCal, hoping to have a solid (if limited) version of it operating by the end of the code sprint weekend.</description>

      <description>The Thunderbird team got off to a challenging start, with problems getting the Django framework initialized and running correctly. Eric discovered two major bugs in the setup: three directory errors in Django’s settings.py file. With the setup problems resolved, the Thunderbird team, started working on the initial problem of writing and testing unit tests. The Nose framework was chosen as the platform for the tests. Louie and Jay succeeded at creating the first fully functional test.</description>

 Basie * Build a toy application in Django and check it into the Subversion repository to prove that they have started learning the framework.  Get Basie running on their development machine and send us a URL so that we can check it. Fix some of our broken test fixtures (long story) and put their changes up for code review.</description>

      <description>Few topics in programming generate as much argument and as little value as wrangles over where the curly braces should go in C programs, or whether CamelCaseNames or pothole_case_names are better [1]. That said, consistency definitely matters&amp;#8212;plenty of studies have shown that MiXiNg styles disrupts comprehension&amp;#8212;so having a style guide and sticking to it is more important than what the style guide actually says.
I&amp;#8217;m therefore grateful that Google has started posting its style guides for all to read.</description>

      <description>John Resig posted links to some of the talks given at the jQuery conference in Boston earlier this year. The most interesting one for me was the overview of how to test with JavaScript: there are several links in there I hadn&amp;#8217;t seen before that might be useful to many of you.</description>

      <description>Many great computer scientists and educators have observed that while we teach students to write code, we don&amp;#8217;t teach them to read it [1]. When you think about it, it&amp;#8217;s ridiculous: architects study hundreds of buildings before designing one of their own, novelist probably read thousands of books before trying to create their own masterpiece [2], and only mathematicians can count how many proofs they go through in detail during their training, so why don&amp;#8217;t programmers study great programs to improve their craft?</description>

      <description>The MarkUs team has spent the week getting their development environments set up. Thanks to a little elbow grease, we seem to be up and running on Linux, OSX, and Windows!
One new team member has even gone so far as to get a patch reviewed, submit it to the repo, and close a ticket. And it was also MarkUs&amp;#8217;s 1000th revision! What an awesome start! Great job, team!

      <description>hello all
I am Eleni Stroulia, the very excited leader of the WikiDev team this term!
I am Greek by birth and Canadian by choice. I started my research in AI, back when knowledge engineering and model-based systems were all the rage (the implied time period will be on the test:-). Since I joined the U of A, I have been working on software engineering solutions for industrially relevant problems. To these problems I usually apply AI methods to semi-automate human processes.</description>

      <description>Hi all, I&amp;#8217;m Titus Brown, a professor at Michigan State University. I&amp;#8217;m participating vicariously in UCOSP through several MSU students, and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to this being a great success (which, note, includes not actually driving Greg stark raving mad) so that I can join in as a project mentor the *next* time the program happens.

I spent the summer of 2008 working at The Centre for Global E-Health Innovation on their remote patient monitoring system. It&amp;#8217;s a rails app that listens for home recorded medical readings and sends out alerts to both doctor and patient if something&amp;#8217;s wrong. It was a fantastic crash course in agile methods and the practical side of software development.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m in my forth year at UofT, doing a specialist in bioinformatics and computational biology, but I&amp;#8217;m thinking about staying for an extra year and switching into AI. I&amp;#8217;d like to go to graduate school after I graduate.
Last year, I did an internship at Red Hat, working on the IcedTea/Openjdk team. I&amp;#8217;ve previously worked on a second year research project in bioinformatics at UofT, and a research project on medical imaging at Oxford.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, I&amp;#8217;m the team leader for Basie this term and I look forward to meeting all of you!
I started programming when I was 9 years old (true nerd roots) on an Apple II-E. The language at the time was BASIC. I graduated to QBASIC, then C, C++, HTML, JavaScript, C#, VB, SQL, etc, etc, etc. I used to think that software development is programming, and therefore languages mean everything, but I&amp;#8217;ve discovered that languages are simply tools that have strengths and weaknesses just like anything else.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m studying in this domain because I wanted to use my favourite tools, computers, completely. I also really like the logic and problem resolution in software programming. In the past year, I&amp;#8217;ve developed web applications in Java using Spring MVC and other frameworks. I&amp;#8217;m excited to learn Ruby on Rails on the MarkUs project. It is also my first experience on an open source project.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone. My name is Eric Burnett, and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to working on WikiDev this term.
I&amp;#8217;m a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, although with co-op and exchange this is actually my fifth calendar year. My focus tends to be on systems and infrastructure type programming, but I enjoy as much variety as I can get. I have done co-op terms as a developer with four companies in four different cities, the most recent being with Google in Seattle over this past summer.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m in my third year at SFU, majoring in Computer Science, like most of us here. My computer-related interests are mostly in operating systems, applications programming and networking, though most other aspects of computers interest me. It&amp;#8217;s very exciting to be getting into the interesting upper-division computer courses.
This summer, I was a C++ programmer with a local games company, which was my first time programming in a production environment.</description>

      <description>Who owns open source software? The simple answer is &amp;#8220;everyone&amp;#8221;, but the reality is more complex. Take a look at these two documents:
 http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/committers-agreement.pdf http://www.canonical.com/contributors  In order to protect people who want to make contributions, many open source projects set up non-profit organizations. If you want to make a contribution, you have to agree to give that organization the right to use your code. That doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you lose your rights (read the second paragraph of the Canonical agreement, for example), but it does stop you from turning around next year and saying, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve decided to start a company around this, so I&amp;#8217;d like you to take it out of your packages.</description>

      <description>An ex-student of mine is trying to decide what web technology to use in the project he&amp;#8217;s about to start working on. The three choices are Java plus some kind of framework, Django and Python (which he knows very well), or Ruby on Rails (which he doesn&amp;#8217;t, but could pick up quickly). The argument in favor of Java plus whatever is that his employer is sure to be able to hire good Java programmers at a reasonable price for the next decade, but as he points out, doing small or medium-sized project in Java takes longer and hurts more than doing it in a dynamic language like Python or Ruby.</description>

      <description>There are a number of tools available, both open-source and commercial which get lumped into the bucket of &amp;#8216;functional testing tools&amp;#8217;. Essentially they help you, well, test the functionality of your application.
One of these tools for testing web-based applications is Selenium. Selenium has at its core three different components: a record/playback tool (Se-IDE), language bindings (Se-RC) and a distributed execution framework (Se-Grid).
I put up a post on my blog called The Selenium Value Chain which briefly discusses each and the progression between them.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Josh McCarthy and I&amp;#8217;ll be working on Basie this semester.
I&amp;#8217;m a fourth year Computer Science student with a minor in Mathematics at Memorial University. I am just coming out of an eight month internship at ICAN, working on software for the marine industry. I haven&amp;#8217;t yet decided where I want to specialize in Computer Science, but I am particularly interested in human-computer interaction and I love programming.</description>

      <description>Hi everyone. My name is Mary Mootoo and I will be working on the Ingres project this semester. I am a computer science senior at the University of the Virgin Islands on the St. Croix Campus.
I have been exposed to different computer languages such as C++, Java, Perl, and Visual Basic. I have never worked in Python before but I’m sure I will have fun on this project. I am anxious about seeing how we will all cope with the distance between us.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ll be working on the Eclipse4Edu project. I am really excited about this class because I have never really worked on any projects that aren&amp;#8217;t for school projects. I mean this is for school, but it will also be used outside of school. If that makes any sense. After my degree I hope to take my computing knowledge into the oilfield and work on data acquisition hardware and software for downhole tools.</description>

      <description>Hello. My name is Ian Lienert. I am currently undergoing my fourth year of an Hon.B.Sc. in Computer Science: Foundations at University of Toronto. I am relatively new to programming, having only developed a deep interest in Computer Science during first year (during which I was enrolled as a math major). I am most interested in complexity and logic.
This term, I will be continuing to work on Basie, since the project piqued my interest during the summer when I was writing a database migration tool for it.</description>

My name is Melanie Gaudet and I am going to work on MarkUs project this fall. I have started my journey with computers by a 3 years study in computer science(CEGEP). I have been hired in a great company, first as Progress database’s administrator, and then as programmer-analyst and finally as project leader. The programming language I have been using the most so far is Progress, but I have tried many others so even though I have never worked with Rubby, I know that I will learn.</description>

      <description>How should a group of people find a time for a meeting? If they all work for the same organization, their availability might already be in a shared system like Outlook (though that&amp;#8217;s by no means guaranteed). Ten years ago, Jon Udell pointed out that online tools were a good lightweight solution to this problem. The MarkUs team is already using WhenIsGood to figure out when they can get together; if your project hasn&amp;#8217;t already picked a meeting time, maybe you&amp;#8217;d like to give it a try too.</description>

Of the first dozen who replied, half mailed me back directly; the other half just hit &amp;#8220;reply&amp;#8221;, and wouldn&amp;#8217;t you know it, Google Groups sets message headers to send replies to the whole list by default.
Oops.
So, without further ado, here&amp;#8217;s my first apology of the term&amp;#8212;I should have checked what the default setting was, then changed it.</description>

      <description>Mike Conley  Hi, I&amp;#8217;m Mike Conley, and I&amp;#8217;m one of the TA&amp;#8217;s for this course. I will be helping Karen Reid manage the MarkUs Project this semester. I&amp;#8217;m a Masters student at the University of Toronto in the Software Engineering group, and I just finished my undergrad at UofT, doubling in Computer Science and Dramatic Arts.
I&amp;#8217;ve been working on MarkUs since September, 2008. I&amp;#8217;ve been web programming in one form or another for over a decade, but MarkUs has been my first time working on a fairly sophisticated Ruby on Rails project.</description>

      <description>We officially kick off next week (though a lot has already happened), so:
 If you have not yet signed up for the Google Group we&amp;#8217;re using for administrative matters, please do so. (Names of those who appear not to have signed up are at the bottom of this message.) If your spam filter ate the invite, please let me know and I&amp;#8217;ll re-issue. If you are a student, you should have received a welcoming message from your project lead with details about the project, how it&amp;#8217;s going to be managed, etc.</description>

      <description>How do you manage development when two or more people (or teams) are making major incompatible changes at the same time? The answer is to create branches in your version control repository, but that can go sour in many ways. If you&amp;#8217;d like some advice on how to do it right, check out:
 &amp;#8220;High-Level Best Practices in Software Configuration Management&amp;#8221; from the folks who make Perforce (which is still my favorite version control system).</description>

      <description>Adam Goucher taught me most of what I know about quality assurance. He&amp;#8217;s now in charge of the same at Zerofootprint, as well as a regular speaker at agile and testing conferences, and has kindly agreed to give the MarkUs team some guidance this fall. (Basie and Thunderbird teams take note: much of what he says applies to you too.) His thirty-second guide is a good place to start; I look forward to hearing more from him.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re very pleased to welcome our first students from Carleton University in Ottawa, and Memorial University in Newfoundland&amp;#8212;and not just because this means we&amp;#8217;ll have students this term who can dabble their toes in three different oceans :-). Ah, if only there was a university that bordered the Arctic Ocean&amp;#8230;
This brings the total number of students to 46, which is nearly double our original target of two dozen. The budget for bringing them together Sept 25-27 won&amp;#8217;t stretch much further, so we&amp;#8217;re going to close the door on enrolment for the fall in just a few days.</description>

      <description>Over on the MarkUs blog, Karen Reid has posted an introduction to the team for the fall, and promised to outline projects the students might take on. Meanwhile, Bill Konrad has posted some project ideas for Basie, and I&amp;#8217;ll follow up with an introduction to the team later this week. We should have all our students in place by the end of this week; things will start moving pretty quickly once Labor Day has come and gone.</description>

      <description>I spoke yesterday with Jon Udell about goals for ElmCity for this fall. He has since posted two very cool things:
 Using FriendFeed to manage a loosely-coupled team. Pulling project members&amp;#8217; own blog postings, Facebook status updates, tweets, and the like together in one place is probably as cost-effective a way to manage a team as the usual mailing list + IRC channel. A lengthy description of how to make elmcity and WordPress play nicely together.</description>

      <description>More good news: Minnesota State and the University of the Virgin Islands are putting in two students each, and we&amp;#8217;ve had one more from Michigan State sign up (project yet to be determined). That means that Basie, ElmCity, MarkUs, RoboCup, and WikiDev are fully staffed for the fall; we just need to fill in the Eclipse4Edu, Ingres, and Thunderbird teams and we&amp;#8217;ll be ready to go (for some value of &amp;#8220;ready&amp;#8221;, of course 🙂 ).</description>

      <description>Jason Cohen of SmartBear recently posted an article about &amp;#8220;survivor bias&amp;#8220;. His basic message is that you have to look at failures as well as successes in order to get a fair picture of what works and what doesn&amp;#8217;t. By some estimates, 95% or more of the projects on open source portals like SourceForge and Google Code are inactive; looking at why they didn&amp;#8217;t pan out is at least as informative as looking at the few that did.</description>

      <description>Ellen Ko&amp;#8217;s post on the Google Summer of Code blog is good advice for students doing cross-country projects as well: making contact with your project lead early, and staying in contact regularly during the term, greatly improves your chances of success. Gopal Kapur&amp;#8217;s advice on how to report status is worth reading too: the more direct you are, the more quickly your project lead and teammates can help you.</description>

      <description>The idea of running cross-country projects was inspired by the work of many other people. Looking at what they&amp;#8217;ve done might help students and faculty understand what we&amp;#8217;re likely to accomplish, and why we&amp;#8217;re doing things the way we are.
First up is Google Summer of Code, &amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;a global program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source software projects.&amp;#8221; 2500 students have done GSoC since its inception in 2005; each student is matched with an existing open source project and a mentor, and works full-time for 12 weeks on something specific.</description>

      <description>One of the most interesting parts of this course for me is watching students decide what projects to work on. When answering their questions, I frequently find myself quoting something that Wayne Gretzky once said when asked what made him such a great player: &amp;#8220;A good hockey player goes where the puck is. A great hockey player goes where the puck is going to be.&amp;#8221; Five years ago, when Napster was making headlines, students typically wanted to write peer-to-peer filesharing tools; today, many of them want to do Ruby on Rails, social networking, or iPhone development.</description>

      <description>Our final project(s) for the Fall 2009 term are now on the web. There&amp;#8217;s an &amp;#8220;s&amp;#8221; in parentheses because it&amp;#8217;ll be up to the students to decide which of the two we&amp;#8217;ll take on. One involves working with geospatial (map) data; the other is to extend Django&amp;#8216;s object/relational mapping layer (the goo that stuffs objects into database tables and restores them as necessary) to work with the Ingres database. Both will give students a chance to work with some very cool technologies; I look forward to seeing who picks them up.</description>

      <description>The previous post touched on the need for more emphasis on evidence-based results in software engineering. This is a rapidly growing area of research&amp;#8212;many of the papers at this year&amp;#8217;s International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE&amp;#8217;09) presented, included, or referenced experiments or field studies of one kind or another.
Alongside this, there is growing interest in software engineering as a human activity, which has led many researchers to look at fields like social psychology.</description>

      <description>Following up the theme of the previous post on habits, this article discusses ten habits developers have to break in order to be successful with Scrum (a popular agile development methodology). A lot of the author&amp;#8217;s points are good ones, but others are straw men set up just to be knocked over. For example, &amp;#8220;Traditional project management is very stubborn about setting the project plan and sticking to it no matter what,&amp;#8221; is a caricature of engineering-style project management.</description>

      <description>A new study shows that the more stressed you are, the more likely you are to rely on habits instead of thinking through what&amp;#8217;s best for your actual situation. (OK, it actually shows that for rats, but it&amp;#8217;s easy to believe that the results apply to human beings as well.) As Dave Rooney explains in a recent blog post, this is why you have to drill and drill until doing the right thing is your habit: if you don&amp;#8217;t, then when the going gets rough, you&amp;#8217;ll revert to your earlier (and probably less productive) training, which will then increase your stress, and down you go.</description>

      <description>One of the questions programmers often ask (and are often asked) is, &amp;#8220;Are we done yet?&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s often hard to know: unlike spaghetti, you can&amp;#8217;t just throw software against the wall to see if it sticks. &amp;#8220;When we run out of time&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;when we run out of money&amp;#8221; are common answers in the real world, but there are better ways, and this page shows one of them. Each row represents a module in Firefox; the numbers show what percentage of the lines and functions in that module are exercised by tests.</description>

      <description>From Blake Winton, the main technical contact for the Thunderbird project:
For this term, I think students will be working on a Django (Python) site to manage the ISP configuration information for Thunderbird. There may also be some Javascript work to hook in to whatever pieces need to be added to the database.
To quote David Ascher (who&amp;#8217;s in charge of Mozilla Messaging):
 From a student project POV, especially given the schedule (fall, when we&amp;#8217;ll be locking things down in TB3), I suspect getting them working on the Django site that powers the database that manages the autoconfig data would be an interesting idea.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;re pleased to add three more students to our fall roster from the University of Alberta in Edmonton. That brings the number of participating schools to six, with four more in the wings. And Blake Winton, a freelance software developer in Toronto, is now on board to mentor our Thunderbird project.</description>

      <description>Hot on the heels of yesterday&amp;#8217;s news about students from Toronto, Waterloo, and Simon Fraser comes word that three students from Michigan State University will be joining us as well. That brings the total to 21, and it&amp;#8217;s still just the first week of August.</description>
