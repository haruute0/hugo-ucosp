  <p>As we prepare for the next group of students who will start in January, we are seeing some turnover in the project offerings for UCOSP, so I&#8217;d like to welcome the newcomers and thank the project mentors from the past term.</p>

<p>The project mentors for Waterbear, CodeIgniter, and Mylyn are all based in Vancouver which makes it more difficult to attend a code sprint in Toronto.  It has been great working with Dethe, James and Sam, and I hope we will have a chance to work with you again in the future!</p>

<p>We are also saying goodbye a long-term project: Phonegap.  Tim Windsor has moved to a different job and is not able to supervise students this term.  Tim has been a terrific mentor over several years, and it would be a great pleasure to work with him again.</p>

<p>We are welcoming two new projects this term, both from Mozilla: <span class="">Jupyter Notebooks for Data Analysis, and Code Coverage Explorer.  I&#8217;m excited to see what students will do on both of these projects.</span></p>
