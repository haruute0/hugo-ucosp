  <p>James Zhao writes:</p>

<p>This is the first blog post from the UCOSP Umple Team for Winter 2012. We are working on <a href="http://try.umple.org">Umple</a> project, which is a modeling tool and programming language which allows one to perform model-oriented programming.</p>

<p>My fellow USCOP colleagues have been working on some interesting projects. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/UCOSPLogAdamDzialoszynski">Adam Dzialoszynski</a> has been working on SQL statement generation, which allows Umple to generate an SQL database schema. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/UCOSPLogSonyaAdams">Sonya Adams</a> has been working on adding a new feature to the Umple language which allows a class to be declared as immutable. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/UCOSPLogJordanJohns">Jordan Johns</a> has been working on improving how code comments written in Umple code are saved and transferred to the compiled destination programming language code. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/UCOSPLunaLu">Luna Lu</a> is currently working on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/issues/detail?id=142">issue 142</a> which deals with a bug in the language where deletion on a object that has a 1-to-many association is not working. <a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/UCOSPSongBaeChoi">Song Bae Choi</a> is working on <a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/issues/detail?id=21">issue 21</a>, where Umple in a certain circumstance generates uncompilable Java code.</p>

<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/UCOSPLogJamesZhao">What I have been working on</a> is to make the Umple compiler appear more like the gcc compiler. I have started by adding command line options to the Umple compiler, implementing some of the simpler command line options, such as printing the current compiler version number. I am currently working on a command line option feature, which can control the programming language Umple will output.</p>

<p>After having started working on Umple for three weeks, I have learned how to look at large projects with multiple components. Also now understand the use of ant build scripts, which will be very useful in the future. A challenge now is juggling time between my other busy courses and Umple work. I expect this to be a very important skill to have since I would like to participate in more OpenSouce projects in the future.</p>
