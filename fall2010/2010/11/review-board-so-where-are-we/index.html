<p>If you’ve been following this blog, you’ll know that the team has been working very hard on their projects.  But I’ll bet those status reports can be a bit cryptic sometimes.</p>

<p>So here’s my take on where we are so far, in no particular order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Hongbin has been working on an extension that will allow communication between Review Board and various bug-trackers.  Currently, his extension listens for events on Review Board (such as publishing a review request, publishing a review), and then alerts the appropriate issue/bug in the bug-tracker by posting a comment with a link to the review request.  Hongbin’s extension currently only works with Google Code projects, but will eventually be extended to other bug-trackers as well (Bugzilla, Github’s issue tracker, etc).</li>
<li>Laila has put together a new version of the Windows Review Board installer.  The installer is responsible for making sure a Windows machine has everything it needs in order to get an instance of Review Board up and running.  Laila is also working on a project that will allow review requests to have files attached to them.</li>
<li>Lindsey and Brendan have been putting together an impressive suite of client tools to interact with the new Review Board API.  The monolithic “post-review” script will, I believe, be eventually modified to use these scripts.  The scripts are also designed to be easily imported, so that developers can write their own tools to interact with Review Board.</li>
<li>Lianne has been working on an extension that will give Review Board WebHook notification abilities.  This means that, when various events happen on Review Board, the extension can send a request to a remote server to trigger another action.  Example:  when a review request has been marked as submitted, the Webhook might signal a script that publishes a notification to Twitter, or to an IRC bot, or to an RSS feed, etc.</li>
<li>Kevin has completed his “collapsible-reviews” project: for review requests with a long series of reviews/revisions, we can save on vertical screen real-estate by automatically collapsing the reviews that have been read.  Kevin has also implemented a one-click Ship-It function, which makes easy reviews even easier.  Kevin is now working on the designs for a new user profile page for Review Board.</li>
</ol>
