  <p>Planning is in full swing for the fall term.  Students and faculty are definitely thinking about September.  Looking at our registration form we already have about half the number of students we expect signed up and more are starting to roll in.</p>

<p>Our fall code sprint will be held at the Mozilla offices in downtown Toronto.  Their community space is a great place to work, and Mike Hoye and his team are excellent hosts.</p>

<p>We are still finalizing the list of projects.  We have more turnover this year than usual, but the potential new projects looks very interesting.  Longtime projects MarkUs, ReviewBoard, and Umple will be back, and I&rsquo;ll post descriptions of the new projects as soon as they are available.</p>
