For the most part we are all trying to wrap things up. Here&#8217;s how we plan to divide the final work load.

**Yulia + Ioana**: Look into fixing coordinate system.

**Chani**: Will put together a skeleton of the document.

**Patrik**: Will write up an overview of the source code by Tuesday.

**Alex**: Plans to finish his passing improvements and contribute a write up of why we choose the python code.

**Everybody**: Contribute to the document and consider tweaks to improve overall performance.
