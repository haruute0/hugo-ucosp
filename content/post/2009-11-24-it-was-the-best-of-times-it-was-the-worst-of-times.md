I am impressed with how much was accomplished in the end. I must say that it is not more than I what was planning/hoping for but at the same time, throughout the course, I had this nagging feeling that things will not come together, and, in the end, we wouldn&#8217;t have anything &#8220;complete&#8221; to show for it. Well we do, and that&#8217;s great!

In spite of notes and discussions and todos and tickets, we still managed to do a few things multiple times (stepping on each other&#8217;s toes).

This was my fist time doing the course as a team lead, maybe next time, it will be even better! And if I had not already decided to do it again, I would decide to do so now.
