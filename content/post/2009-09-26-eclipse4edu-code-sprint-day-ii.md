This morning we got right into coding. Nil and I(Peter) started working on bug 250659 a feature to have assignments created in XML and displayed to students via an Assignment/Reference view. Maxime and Maciej worked on the eclipse code completetion, the ability for the code completetion window to actually stay open if you make a typo. Dennis lost the rock paper scissors match and was coding solo today, he was working at removing items from the editor context menu. Today marks the beginning of our second two week sprint.
