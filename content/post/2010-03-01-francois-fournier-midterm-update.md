Hi everyone,

this is my midterm report for Basie project.

The first part of the project was to fix bugs to have a good representation for PyCon. Version 0.6 is now released and we can now work on 0.7 release.

I&#8217;m working with Guillaume Simard for 0.7, our goal is to add front-end test for the entire application. To do that, we will use Selenium. The setup to use Selenium is praticaly completed and we have 7 weeks left  to write tests for every apps in Basie.

Working on this kind of project is, for now, a great experience and it is also great to work with people from other universities.

Thank you UCOSP for this opportunity.
