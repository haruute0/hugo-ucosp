Like the first two days of the code sprint, yesterday was a very productive day for the MarkUs team. Review Board continued to receive a workout as review requests kept coming in. We also had a meeting in the afternoon to discuss our tasks for the rest of the semester. You&#8217;ll want to check out the [exciting new features](http://blog.markusproject.org/?p=337) that we are planning on adding to MarkUs!
