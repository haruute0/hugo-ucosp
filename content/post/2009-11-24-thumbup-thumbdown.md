Thumbs up:  The code sprint where all students and participating parties gathering face to face provides a precious opportunity for them to know each other, especially on each others&#8217; working style, which helped a lot during the course later on.

Thumbs down:  Difference between schools&#8217; expectation from students leads to a significant difference in students&#8217; motivation. If the students are grouped into sub teams working on the same smaller project, we should weight more on continuous communication. Since once if either one side is not proactive in responding, and not physically reachable by the other members in the same team, co-operation thus becomes almost impossible.
