Hi everyone !

My name is Guillaume Simard ( pronounced &#8216; [Giiyom](http://media.merriam-webster.com/soundc11/bix/bixgui03.wav) &#8216; ), I&#8217;m currently doing my last semester at Université Laval in Software Engineering ( sounds much better than &#8216; Génie Logiciel &#8216; .. ! ). These last four years, I&#8217;ve worked mostly on web applications and video game development ( a hobby of mine ). I like using Python, which is part of why I chose Basie as my last project for my degree.

I am really looking forward to meeting you during the weekend ! I haven&#8217;t had the chance to see Toronto before and meeting fellow developers is always a great experience.
