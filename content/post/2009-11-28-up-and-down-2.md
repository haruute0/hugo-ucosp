Up: One of the best parts for me was learning what a great thing constructive criticism is. I practically look forward to a denied patch because of the amount of feedback and the opportunity for improvement. This was refreshing after just getting a discouragingly low mark.

Down: The delay of email sometimes causes all progress to halt because I just didn&#8217;t know how to proceed. This would cause breaks and dry spells, something I found tough to deal with.
