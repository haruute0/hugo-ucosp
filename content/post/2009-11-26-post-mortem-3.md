Thumbs up:

  * A chance to make a name on a open source project (&#8220;eclipse&#8221;)
  * The formation that Wayne gave us during the code sprint, We would  definitly not have acomplished as much without it.
  * Regular project conference call with the team and  Dwight.
  * We managed to work as a real team and set-up a svn and irc channel and have 2 irc meeting each week to give each other a status update.

Thumbs down:

  * The start of the Eclipse4Edu project (no svn, different goal for every member : disparate team)
  * More code rewiew by our responsible or someone more experimented would have been great.
  * To blog on wordpress should not be mandatory but it&#8217;s really nice to have the opportunity to do it.
