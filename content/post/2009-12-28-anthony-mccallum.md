My language of choice is JAVA, but I also have experience with a variety of other languages.  I will be working on the Ingres project this coming term.  This will be my first opportunity to work on an open source project, and I am excited for the challenge!  I&#8217;ve previously done internships with RIM in Ottawa as well as a bioninformatics lab in Singapore.  I am also currently working part time for a UBC affiliated lab.  Looking forward to meeting everyone at the code sprint!
