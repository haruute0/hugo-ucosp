Hi, I&#8217;m [Alexandru Totolici](http://alexandrutotolici.com "Alexandru Totolici"). I hail from UBC, starting the 6th winter term of my Bachelor of Science program (majoring in Computer Science). I&#8217;ll be working on Mercurial. <img alt="alexandru" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/79900/portret.jpg" title="alexandru" class="alignright" width="150" height="200" />

I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to work with some great people during co-ops at WebCT (now Blackboard), MDA, Safe Software, and Kodak, as well as during my time with UBC&#8217;s Office of Learning Technology. I&#8217;ve touched on QA, GUI, server API testing, backend tool development, WordPress and MediaWiki plugin development, and I&#8217;ve done it in everything from Bash to C#.

Things I care about:

  * computer security;
  * user experience;
  * omitting needless code;
  * rapid development;
  * making stuff;
  * making stuff better.

Looking forward to the sprint, first round of caffeine is on me!
