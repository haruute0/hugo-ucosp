Preparations for the next term are well underway.  We are finalizing projects with our project mentors, including some exciting potential new projects.  We haven't updated the project list yet, so stay tuned.

The code sprint will be at the Mozilla offices in downtown Toronto Sept 22-24. Students will be getting email shortly to start booking flights.
