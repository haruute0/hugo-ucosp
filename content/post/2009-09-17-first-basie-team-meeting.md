The Basie team had their first online meeting yesterday. Bill Konrad has posted a [short summary](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=933) on the Basie blog; long story short, we&#8217;re pushing ahead with four sub-projects:

  * Dashboard: Zuzel and Ted
  * Diff Engine: Bill and John
  * Milestones/Calendar: Ian and Josh
  * IRC Integration: Tony and Andrew

Stay tuned!
