I think every student should read Evan Robinson&#8217;s article &#8220;[Why Crunch Mode Doesn&#8217;t Work](http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons)&#8220;. It&#8217;s a short, readable summary of research into the effects of sleep deprivation, and very relevant to anyone who&#8217;s thinking about staying up until 3:30 a.m. to finish an assignment&#8230;
