Over on the MarkUs blog, Karen Reid has posted [an introduction to the team for the fall](http://blog.markusproject.org/?p=242), and promised to outline projects the students might take on. Meanwhile, Bill Konrad has posted some [project ideas](http://blog.basieproject.org/?p=917) for Basie, and I&#8217;ll follow up with an introduction to the team later this week. We should have all our students in place by the end of this week; things will start moving pretty quickly once Labor Day has come and gone.
