Our project, [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com "mercurial"), already announced their participation in Google&#8217;s Summer of Code 2010 via the developer mailing list. I suspect many other projects are doing the same, so even though there&#8217;s no official information on Google&#8217;s own [SoC](http://code.google.com/soc/) page (yet), you might want to consider preparing your application. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed UCOSP so far and want to continue the experience, GSoC looks like a great avenue to do so.
