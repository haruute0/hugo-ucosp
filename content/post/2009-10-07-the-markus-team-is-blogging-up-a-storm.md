Check out their [latest post](http://blog.markusproject.org/?p=488), or the [one before it](http://blog.markusproject.org/?p=475), or&#8212;but you get the picture. Once Canadian Thanksgiving is over, I&#8217;m going to start insisting that each member of the Basie team post to our blog weekly, and I&#8217;ll encourage other team leads to demand the same of their students.
