The MarkUs team has spent the week getting their development environments set up.  Thanks to a little elbow grease, we seem to be up and running on Linux, OSX, and Windows!

One new team member has even gone so far as to get a patch reviewed, submit it to the repo, and close [a ticket](https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/drproject/csc49x/olm_rails/ticket/376).  And it was also MarkUs&#8217;s 1000th revision!  What an awesome start!  Great job, team!
