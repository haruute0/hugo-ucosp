title: When Is Good?

How should a group of people find a time for a meeting? If they all work for the same organization, their availability might already be in a shared system like Outlook (though that&#8217;s by no means guaranteed). Ten years ago, Jon Udell [pointed out](http://jonudell.net/GroupwareReport.html#27) that online tools were a good lightweight solution to this problem. The [MarkUs team](http://ucosp.wordpress.com/project-markus/) is already using [WhenIsGood](http://whenisgood.net/) to figure out when they can get together; if your project hasn&#8217;t already picked a meeting time, maybe you&#8217;d like to give it a try too.
