We resumed our regular meeting time today and the IRC log is at [http://hypatia.cs.ualberta.ca/ucosp/index.php/UCOSP\_IRC:Tue\_Oct\_13\_2009](http://hypatia.cs.ualberta.ca/ucosp/index.php/UCOSP_IRC:Mon_Oct_19_2009). We have a plan for what will be done by the end of the month and we are making good progress (fingers crossed) towards it.

The interesting aspects of this week&#8217;s and last week&#8217;s discussion have been, in my view (and I welcome my team members to clarify refine and completely revise it), that

  * you need a specific scenario to figure out the details where the you-know-who hides, and 
  * pictures are worth a lot of words,

Also I am happy that we have subteams, especially the two pairs. It makes me more comfortable that no major bloopers are happening (I hope this assessment is not revised:-) I wish we were a team of six!

All in all, I am very excited about the outcome I envision at the end of the term.
