title: Getting up to speed with Pony-Build

Since we couldn’t all meet for the Sprint code in Toronto, the first steps into pony-build were to get to speed with the software layout and with working with Git. We were constantly communicating via Skype and our group lead Pr. Titus was very patient and helpful throughout the process.

We first got the software running on Linux via Lyorn then on our own computer (on Windows and Mac). Then our next task was to write one of the client scripts for existing packages, commit it, and push it to Github.  We had the option to adapt existing scripts to build our own package.

The build commands are usually individual to each package, so our next task is to make sure the build scripts actually build and report to the central server as expected.

Being in the pony-build team is a continuous learning experience that I&#8217;m enjoying everyday more and more.
