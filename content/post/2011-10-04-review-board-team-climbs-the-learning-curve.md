There is a great description of the steps students took to getting fully up to speed and moving forward on their projects on the [Review Board blog](http://reviewboardstudents.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/ucosp-blog-post-october-2nd-2011/ "Review Board blog").

I&#8217;m glad to hear that the code sprint was worthwhile!
