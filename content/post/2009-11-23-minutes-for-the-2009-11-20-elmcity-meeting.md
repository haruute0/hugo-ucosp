The minutes themselves are available [here](http://jorygraham.com/elmcity/2009-11-20.180424-0500EST.html).

This week we tried to figure out what we&#8217;ll try to have done for our deadline next week. The list we obtained by the end of the meeting was as follows:

  * Hooking up the dev database.
  * Having all the external libraries situated under a single directory.
  * Supporting more TABULAR sites.
  * Supporting a few CALENDAR sites.
  * Hooking up pluginFinder to the generic plugins.
  * Supporting a query on a single url that tells you two things: if it&#8217;s parsable, and which plugin handles the parsing.

There&#8217;s lots to be done as the project wraps up, but we&#8217;re still optimistic about our outcome.
