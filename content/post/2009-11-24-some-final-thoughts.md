I have really enjoyed working on MarkUs this semester!

One of the things I liked the best was that our TA and one of the students on our team had both already worked on our project before and they knew both MarkUs and Ruby on Rails inside and out. I think that everyone on the team benefited from their past experiences and it was great to be able to get advice from them and ask them questions throughout the semester.

One downside of working with students from different universities is the lack of face-to-face communication. Our team did a really good job of communicating with each other through blog posts, review requests, and IRC meetings but it definitely would have been nice to meet with everyone in-person again.

I&#8217;m looking forward to working on MarkUs again next semester!
