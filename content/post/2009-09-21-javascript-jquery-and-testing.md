John Resig [posted links](http://ejohn.org/blog/talks-at-the-2009-jquery-conference/) to some of the talks given at the [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) conference in Boston earlier this year. The most interesting one for me was the overview of [how to test with JavaScript](http://www.slideshare.net/jeresig/understanding-javascript-testing): there are several links in there I hadn&#8217;t seen before that might be useful to many of you.
